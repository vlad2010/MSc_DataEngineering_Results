The provided C code implements a basic bubble sort algorithm and prints an array before and after sorting. However, there aren't any direct security issues with this specific piece of code, as it is largely isolated from external input. Nonetheless, I will outline potential security practices to consider when dealing with C code in a more general context, which may also apply if the code is expanded or modified.

1. **Buffer Overflows (CWE-120)**: While the specific snippet as given does not have a buffer overflow vulnerability, if the function ever takes input from a user or another source that isn't tightly controlled, it could be subject to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Ensuring all array accesses stay within bounds is crucial. Using safer functions or bounds checking can prevent these issues.

2. **Improper Handling of Untrusted Data (CWE-20)**: If the array were later modified to be user-supplied, input validation would be essential to ensure that unexpected, unvalidated input doesn't cause undefined behavior.

3. **Use of "printf" (CWE-134)**: When using `printf`, it's important to ensure that the format string is controlled. In this case, since the format string is a static string, there's no direct format string vulnerability, but if this function were logging user-supplied data directly, it could become a security concern.

4. **Resource Management (CWE-401)**: If dynamic memory allocation were introduced, proper allocation and deallocation would be necessary to prevent leaks.

Since the snippet doesn't include direct vulnerabilities, any fixes would more accurately be improvements or extensions for robustness in different contexts. Below is a code snippet demonstrating the use of safer practices:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Static array for the example, replace with dynamic allocation for variable input sizes
    int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    // Ensures the array has elements before operations
    if (n <= 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Invalid array size.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Original array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    bubbleSort(arr, n);

    printf("Sorted array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Checklist when Extending:
- For any user input: sanitize and validate thoroughly.
- If dynamic memory allocation is needed, ensure proper deallocation and handle allocation failures.
- If dealing with strings, prefer safer variants like `snprintf` over `sprintf`.

Following best practices ensures that even simple programs are robust against future changes or when incorporated into larger projects.
