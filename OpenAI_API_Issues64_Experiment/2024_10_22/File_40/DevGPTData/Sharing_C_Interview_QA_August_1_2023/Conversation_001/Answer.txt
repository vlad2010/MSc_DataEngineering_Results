ChatGPTSure, I'll answer each question with a brief explanation and provide code examples where applicable.Advantage of C language?
C language has several advantages:Efficiency: C provides low-level memory manipulation and direct hardware access, making it highly efficient.Portability: C code can be easily adapted for different platforms with minimal changes.Wide Application: C is used in various domains like system programming, embedded systems, and application development.Strong Community and Libraries: C has a large community and numerous libraries for various purposes.Structure and Union Difference?
Both structures and unions are used to group multiple variables of different data types into a single entity.Structure: Each member occupies its own memory location, and the total memory is the sum of all member sizes.Union: All members share the same memory location, and the size of the union is the size of the largest member.What is a Function in C?
A function in C is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It has a name, a return type (if any), and may take input parameters.Difference between Call by Value and Call by Reference?Call by Value: Function arguments are passed by copying their values. Changes to the parameters inside the function do not affect the original values.Call by Reference: Function arguments are passed by their memory addresses. Changes to the parameters inside the function affect the original values.What is Recursion?
Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. It simplifies complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.What is a Pointer? Advantages and Disadvantages?Pointer: A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. It allows direct memory manipulation.Advantages: Efficient memory usage, dynamic memory allocation, and direct access to hardware.Disadvantages: Pointers can cause segmentation faults and memory leaks if not used carefully.What is a String? All the methods' names.
In C, a string is an array of characters terminated by a null '\0' character. String handling functions include strcpy, strcat, strlen, strcmp, etc.Array in C > Type?
Arrays in C can be of various types, such as integer arrays, character arrays, floating-point arrays, etc.Where can we use Multi-dimensional Array?
Multi-dimensional arrays are used to represent data in multiple dimensions, like matrices and tables.What is a token in the C language? How many tokens are there?
In C, a token is the smallest individual unit in a program. There are five types of tokens: keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, and special symbols.What is the Identifier?
An identifier is a user-defined name used to identify variables, functions, and other elements in a C program. It should follow specific naming rules.Difference between Source Code and Object Code?Source Code: It is the human-readable code written by the programmer in a high-level language like C.Object Code: It is the machine-readable code generated after compiling the source code, represented in binary format.What are Header Files and their usages?
Header files contain function prototypes, macro definitions, and other declarations needed for using libraries and functions. They are included in source files using the #include directive.When to use "void" in a function?
The "void" keyword is used as the return type of a function when the function does not return any value.What is the usage of printf() and scanf()?printf(): It is used to print formatted output to the console or a file.scanf(): It is used to read formatted input from the user or a file.Difference between a global variable and a local variable?Global Variable: It is declared outside any function and is accessible throughout the program.Local Variable: It is declared inside a function and is accessible only within that function.Write a C program for Bubble Sort:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Storage Class in C:
C provides four storage classes:auto: Default storage class for local variables.static: Preserves the value of the variable even between function calls.extern: Used to declare a global variable that is defined in another file.register: Suggests the compiler to use a register for faster access.What is Typecasting?
Typecasting is the conversion of one data type to another. It can be done explicitly using typecast operators like (int), (float), etc.What is the purpose of developing the C language?
C was developed to create the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. It aimed to provide a structured, efficient, and portable programming language for system development.How to create a user-defined Header file?
To create a user-defined header file, follow these steps:Write the function prototypes and necessary declarations in a header file (e.g., "myheader.h").In your source file, include the header file using the #include directive.Compile both the source file and the header file together.What is a Self-Referential Structure?
A self-referential structure is a structure that contains a pointer to another structure of the same type. It is used to create linked data structures like linked lists and trees. Example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or have more questions!
