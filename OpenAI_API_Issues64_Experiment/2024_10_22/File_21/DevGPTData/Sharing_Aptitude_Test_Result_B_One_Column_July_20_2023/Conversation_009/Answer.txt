ChatGPTLet's interpret the functional dependencies in the given notation:A -> B: This means that attribute A uniquely determines attribute B. For any value of A, there will be a unique value of B in the same row.A -> C: This means that attribute A uniquely determines attribute C. For any value of A, there will be a unique value of C in the same row.(BC) -> A: This means that the combination of attributes B and C together (BC) uniquely determines attribute A. For any combination of values for B and C, there will be a unique value of A in the same row.A -> (BC): This means that attribute A uniquely determines the combination of attributes B and C together (BC). For any value of A, there will be a unique combination of values for B and C in the same row.Functional dependencies help in understanding how attributes in a relation are related to each other and are used during the process of database normalization to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy.
