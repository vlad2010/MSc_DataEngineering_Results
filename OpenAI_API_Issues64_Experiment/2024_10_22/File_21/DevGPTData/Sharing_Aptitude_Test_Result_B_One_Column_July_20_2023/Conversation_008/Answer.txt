ChatGPTThe notation "A -> BC" represents a functional dependency in the context of database design and normalization. It indicates that whenever a certain value (or set of values) for attribute A appears in a relation (table), it uniquely determines the values of attributes B and C in that same relation.Let's break down the notation "A -> BC":A, B, and C are attributes (columns) of a relation (table)."A -> BC" means that for any given value of A, there will be a unique combination of values for B and C in the same row.This concept is essential for normalization in databases, where we aim to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity. Functional dependencies help in organizing data in a structured manner and avoid data anomalies.For example, consider a relation (table) representing information about students:Student_IDStudent_NameAgeGender101John25Male102Sarah24Female103Emily23FemaleHere, "Student_ID" uniquely determines "Student_Name" and "Age" but does not determine "Gender." We can represent this functional dependency as:Student_ID -> Student_Name, AgeMeaning, for any given Student_ID, there will be a unique combination of Student_Name and Age in the same row. However, the value of Gender is not uniquely determined by Student_ID, so it is not part of the functional dependency.
