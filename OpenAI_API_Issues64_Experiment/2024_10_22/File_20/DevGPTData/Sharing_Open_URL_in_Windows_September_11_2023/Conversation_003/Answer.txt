ChatGPTNo, running that command in CMD.exe will not open the correct URL. The reason is that the start command in CMD.exe treats the first argument in quotes as the title for the new Command Prompt window that gets opened.You can get around this by providing an empty title argument like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]However, this command will still fail because the URL is incomplete (it lacks the https:// prefix and the domain name).A complete and correct command should look something like this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]
