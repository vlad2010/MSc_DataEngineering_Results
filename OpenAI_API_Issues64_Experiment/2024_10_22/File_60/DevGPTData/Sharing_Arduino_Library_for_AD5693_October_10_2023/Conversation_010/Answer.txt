ChatGPTCertainly! The updateDAC() function will send the command to update the DAC register based on the value in the input register. This is typically done using the UPDATE_DAC command from the ad5693_commands enum.Here's the function implementation along with a Doxygen-compatible comment header:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, we prepare a single-byte buffer containing just the UPDATE_DAC command. We then use the write() method from Adafruit_I2CDevice to send this command over I2C. The function returns true if the write operation was successful and false otherwise.Would you like to add anything else or proceed to the next part?
