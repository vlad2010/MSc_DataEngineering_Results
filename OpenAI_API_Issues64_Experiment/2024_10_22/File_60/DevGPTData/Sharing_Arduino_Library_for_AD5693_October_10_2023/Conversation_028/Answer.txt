ChatGPTCertainly! Below is the updated Arduino test sketch that includes code to reset the DAC, configure it for normal mode with the reference enabled and no 2x gain, and then write a sine wave to the DAC using writeUpdateDAC().[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this sketch, the setup() function initializes the AD5693 chip, resets it, and then configures it for normal mode with the reference enabled and no 2x gain. The loop() function generates a sine wave by iterating through angles from 0 to 2π2\pi2π, calculates the corresponding DAC value as a uint16_t, and then writes this value to the DAC using writeUpdateDAC().Would you like to add anything else or make any modifications?
