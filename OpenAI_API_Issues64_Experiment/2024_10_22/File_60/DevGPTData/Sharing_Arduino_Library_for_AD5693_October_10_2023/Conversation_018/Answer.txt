ChatGPTI apologize for the oversight. If gain2x corresponds to bit D11, then the bit shifts should be adjusted accordingly. Here's the corrected function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this corrected version, gain2x is set to bit D11, newmode (the operating mode) is set to bits D10 and D9, and enable_ref (inverted) is set to bit D8. The rest of the bits are set to zero as specified.Would you like to proceed to the next part of the library?
