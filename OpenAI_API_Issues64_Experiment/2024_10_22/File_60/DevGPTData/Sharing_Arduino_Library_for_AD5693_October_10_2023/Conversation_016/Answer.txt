ChatGPTCertainly! The reset() function will write 0x8000 to the control register to reset the AD5693 chip. This can be done using the WRITE_CONTROL command from the ad5693_commands enum.Here's the function implementation along with a Doxygen-compatible comment header:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, a 3-byte buffer is prepared. The first byte is the WRITE_CONTROL command, and the next two bytes are 0x80 and 0x00, which together form 0x8000. The write() method from Adafruit_I2CDevice is then used to send this 3-byte buffer over I2C. The function returns true if the write operation was successful and false otherwise.Would you like to add anything else or proceed to the next part?
