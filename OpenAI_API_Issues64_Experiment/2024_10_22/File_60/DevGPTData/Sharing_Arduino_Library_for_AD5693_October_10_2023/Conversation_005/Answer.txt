ChatGPTThank you for providing the information from Table 12. Based on this, you can create an enum in C++ to represent the four commands. The enum will make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Here's how you could define it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this enum, the values are based on the DB7, DB6, DB5, and DB4 bits for each command. For example, for the "NOP: do nothing" command, DB7-DB4 are all 0, so the enum value is 0x00. For the "Write input register" command, DB7-DB4 are 0001, which is 0x10 in hexadecimal, and so on.You can then use these enum values in your code to make it more understandable. Would you like to proceed with the next step?
