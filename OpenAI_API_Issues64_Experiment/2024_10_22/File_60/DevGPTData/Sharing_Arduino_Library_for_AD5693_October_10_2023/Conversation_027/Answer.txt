ChatGPTCertainly! Below is the skeleton of an Arduino test sketch that will test every function of the AD5693 library. I've named the library object dacDevice to avoid using the name 'sensor'.[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this sketch, the setup() function initializes the serial port at 115200 baud and waits for it to be ready. It then prints an introductory message and attempts to initialize the AD5693 chip using the begin() function of the library.You can add calls to other library functions in the setup() or loop() functions to fully test the library's capabilities.Would you like to proceed with adding the test code for each function?
