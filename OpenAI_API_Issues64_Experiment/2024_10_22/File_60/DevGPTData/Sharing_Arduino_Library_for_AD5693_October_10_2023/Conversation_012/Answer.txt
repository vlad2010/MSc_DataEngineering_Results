ChatGPTCertainly! The writeUpdateDAC(uint16_t value) function will write a 16-bit value to the input register and then update the DAC register in a single operation. This is typically done using the WRITE_DAC_AND_INPUT command from the ad5693_commands enum.Here's the function implementation along with a Doxygen-compatible comment header:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, a 3-byte buffer is prepared. The first byte is the WRITE_DAC_AND_INPUT command, and the next two bytes are the high and low bytes of the 16-bit value, respectively. The write() method from Adafruit_I2CDevice is then used to send this 3-byte buffer over I2C. The function returns true if the write operation was successful and false otherwise.Would you like to add anything else or proceed to the next part?
