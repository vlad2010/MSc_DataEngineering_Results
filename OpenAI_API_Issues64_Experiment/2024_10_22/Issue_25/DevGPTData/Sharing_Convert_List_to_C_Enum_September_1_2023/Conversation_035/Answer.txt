ChatGPTAbsolutely, reading the bottom two bits and casting to the HUSB238_5VCurrentContract enum type makes perfect sense for the get5VContractA() function.Here's how the function could be implemented:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This function uses Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits to read the bottom two bits (bits 0 and 1) from the PD_STATUS0 register. It then casts the uint8_t value returned by read() to the HUSB238_5VCurrentContract enum type and returns it.Does this look good to you?
