ChatGPTCertainly! You can create a getCCStatus() function that is very similar to the getAttached() function. It will check the 6th bit (also known as "CC_DIR") of the PD_STATUS0 register. Here's how it could look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This function is almost identical to getAttached(), with the difference being the variable names and comments for clarity. The 6th bit of the PD_STATUS0 register is read to determine the "CC_DIR" status.Does this align with what you're looking to implement?
