I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question.
You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way how to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications.
Please write code where detected secutiry issue is fixed, please write all code in one fragment. 

(```cpp
HUSB238_5VCurrentContract Adafruit_HUSB238::get5VContractA() {
  // Create an Adafruit_I2CRegister object for the PD_STATUS0 register
  Adafruit_I2CRegister pdRegister = Adafruit_I2CRegister(i2c_dev, HUSB238_PD_STATUS0);
  
  // Create an Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits object for the bottom two bits (0-1) of PD_STATUS0
  Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits contractABits = Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits(&pdRegister, 2, 0);  // 2 bits starting from the 0th bit
  
  // Read and return the bits, cast to HUSB238_5VCurrentContract
  return (HUSB238_5VCurrentContract) contractABits.read();
}
