ChatGPTThe IP addresses used within network namespaces are isolated from the main network, so there wouldn't be a conflict with existing network configurations on your machine. However, if you're planning to eventually integrate this testing setup into your existing network, or if you want to avoid any confusion, it would be a good idea to use a different subnet like 192.168.3.x for your testing.In the case of network namespaces, they are isolated environments with their own network stack, routes, and interfaces. So, theoretically, you could use the same IP range as your existing networks without a conflict for testing purposes within these namespaces. However, best practice would still be to use a different, non-overlapping subnet to avoid any possible confusion or accidental routing mishaps.
