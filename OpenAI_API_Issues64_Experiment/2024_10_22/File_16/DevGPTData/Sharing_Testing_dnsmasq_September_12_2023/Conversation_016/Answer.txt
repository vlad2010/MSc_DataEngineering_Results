ChatGPTAh, thank you for sharing that information. The behavior you're seeing can indeed vary depending on the specific Ethernet hardware and driver in use. Some Ethernet interfaces will only go to an "UP" state when they detect a physical link (i.e., when an Ethernet cable is connected to a switch, hub, or another device). And yes, the time it takes to transition to an "UP" state can vary as well.Given that you've identified this behavior, you have a couple of options for testing:Physical Loopback: Physically connect the Ethernet interface to a switch or another computer's Ethernet interface to keep it in an "UP" state.Software Loopback: If you're only interested in software testing, some virtualization technologies (like Docker or virtual machines) can create virtual Ethernet interfaces that are always "UP," which might be helpful for your testing.Wait for Interface: If the interface takes a few seconds to come "UP" after being connected, you may consider introducing a delay or a check in your test scripts before starting dnsmasq.It's excellent that you're diving into the details, as this can help you understand better how different network configurations might impact your application.
