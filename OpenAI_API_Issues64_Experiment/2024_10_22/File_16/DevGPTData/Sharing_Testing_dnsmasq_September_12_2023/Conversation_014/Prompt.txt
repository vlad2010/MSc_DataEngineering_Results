I wasn't seeing this before but I've rebooted my computer and now if when I run `./src/dnsmasq -C /home/wink/dnsmasq.test.conf`, which has `interface=enp113s0`, I get a "warning: interface enp113s0 does not currently exist", I'm not sure what changed but I don't recall seeing that before. Also, if I add a static address to enp113s0 I don't see the error. Acutally, now that I think about it for it, to be a dhcp-server it needs to have an address and generally a static address. But I'm still wondering why I didn't see that warning before. Any ideas?
