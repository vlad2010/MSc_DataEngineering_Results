ChatGPTYou're correct in noting that the veth pair in Linux is typically created as a connected pair with a single command. The reason is that veth pairs are intended to act like a virtual Ethernet cable, with two ends that are intrinsically linked. When data is sent into one end, it automatically appears at the other end. This is implemented in the Linux kernel and not something you typically need to (or can) manually control once the pair has been created.In other network setups, like a bridge or a tunnel, you do have the ability to manually connect interfaces, but that's not how veth pairs work by design. They're meant to be a simple, paired construct where each end automatically knows about the other.If you're interested in more complex network setups, you might look into software-defined networking (SDN) solutions, but those are beyond the scope of a typical dnsmasq or dhclient test environment.
