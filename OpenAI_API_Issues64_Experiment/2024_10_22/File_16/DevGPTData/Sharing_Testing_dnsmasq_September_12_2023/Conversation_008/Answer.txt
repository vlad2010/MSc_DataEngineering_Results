ChatGPTYes, if dnsmasq can't write to the default lease file location (/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases) due to permission issues, you can specify a different location for the DHCP lease file using the dhcp-leasefile option in the configuration file or via command line.Configuration FileAdd the following line to your dnsmasq configuration file (dnsmasq.conf):[CODE_BLOCK_0]Replace /path/to/your/dnsmasq.leases with the full path to where you'd like the lease file to be stored. Make sure this is a location that dnsmasq can write to.Command LineAlternatively, you can specify this option when you start dnsmasq:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Again, replace /path/to/your/dnsmasq.leases with your chosen path.Running dnsmasqYou'll then start dnsmasq like so:[CODE_BLOCK_2]By setting the dhcp-leasefile to a location that the dnsmasq process has permission to write to, you should be able to bypass the "Permission denied" issue.
