ChatGPTBoth versions are correct but accomplish slightly different tasks:The first version creates veth1 and veth2 in the default network namespace and then moves them into ns1 and ns2:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The second version directly creates veth1 and veth2 inside the ns1 and ns2 network namespaces:[CODE_BLOCK_1]The second version is a shorthand of the first and is more convenient if you already know which namespaces you'd like the interfaces to reside in when you create them. The first version gives you a bit more flexibility in case you want to manipulate or inspect the interfaces before moving them into a specific namespace.So, either way is fine, and you can use the one that best suits your workflow.
