ChatGPTIn a scenario with multiple Ethernet ports, you can specifically test the DHCP functionality on the unconnected interface (enp113s0 in your case) by using the dhclient command to obtain an IP address from dnsmasq for that specific interface.Here's how you can go about it:Configuring dnsmasqMake sure to configure dnsmasq to listen on enp113s0. Add the following line to your dnsmasq configuration file:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Set the DHCP range by adding another line like:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Starting dnsmasqStart dnsmasq with this configuration. You may run it in the foreground to better observe the logs:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Note that I've set --port=0 to disable the DNS server part of dnsmasq, assuming you're only interested in testing DHCP.Requesting an IP with dhclientThen, you can run the following dhclient commands to release any existing IP configuration on enp113s0 and request a new one:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Observing LogsIf dnsmasq is running in debug mode (-d), you should see the DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST, and DHCPACK packets being logged. This will confirm whether the DHCP allocation is working as expected.Also, you can check if the interface has received the new IP address by running:[CODE_BLOCK_4]or[CODE_BLOCK_5]NoteBe sure that there's no other DHCP server running on the same network segment to which enp113s0 is connected (or planning to connect). If you're running dnsmasq and another DHCP server on the same network, you may end up with IP conflicts.
