ChatGPTCertainly! You can list the network interfaces and their details within a specific network namespace by prepending the ip command with sudo ip netns exec [namespace]. To view the network interfaces within ns1 and ns2, you would use the following commands:For ns1:[CODE_BLOCK_0]For ns2:[CODE_BLOCK_1]These commands will display all network interfaces within the respective network namespaces, along with their associated details like IP addresses, MAC addresses, and state (up or down).You can also focus on a particular interface by appending its name to the end of the command. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_2]This will show details just for veth1 within the ns1 namespace.
