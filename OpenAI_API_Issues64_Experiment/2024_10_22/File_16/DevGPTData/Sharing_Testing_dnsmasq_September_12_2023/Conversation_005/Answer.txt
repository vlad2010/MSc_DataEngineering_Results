ChatGPTWhen dnsmasq starts up as root, it usually changes its UID (User ID) and GID (Group ID) to a less privileged user for security reasons. At the same time, it tries to change the ownership of the log file to that less privileged user. This is why you're seeing the "failed to change owner" warning.Here are a few ways you can handle this:Run dnsmasq as the current user: One way to avoid the warning is to run dnsmasq as the current user (assuming this user has the necessary permissions to bind to the chosen port). This way, dnsmasq won't try to change the ownership because it's already running under your user. But note that normally, you need administrative (root) privileges to bind to port numbers below 1024.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note: This is generally okay for testing but not recommended for production.Specify the User and Group: Use the --user and --group flags to specify which user and group should own the log file. If you set these to your current user and group, you should avoid the warning:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Run dnsmasq with full privileges: This is generally not recommended due to potential security risks, but it would avoid the warning.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Here, the --no-drop flag tells dnsmasq not to drop root privileges.Remember, these approaches are useful for testing and debugging but may not be suitable for a production environment due to the potential security risks. Always consider the security implications when running services with elevated permissions.
