ChatGPTThe NET_RAW capability allows raw socket access, enabling the program to interface directly with network protocols. If dnsmasq is asking for this capability, you can indeed add it using setcap, but it's worth noting that you can set multiple capabilities at the same time.Here's how to set both NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW capabilities:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This command grants both the NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW capabilities to the dnsmasq executable, allowing it to perform its operations without needing to run as root.Be cautious when setting capabilities: these are powerful features that can pose a security risk if misused or if the application has vulnerabilities. Always be sure you understand the implications of the capabilities you are setting.After you've set the capabilities, you should be able to run dnsmasq as a non-root user but still have the required capabilities:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Remember to re-apply the capabilities if you recompile dnsmasq or move the executable.
