ChatGPTSure, I'll help you write test cases for your prot_queue implementation. Given that your queue is designed for generic use, we'll need a specific type to test with. For simplicity, let's use int.The following will be the general approach for the tests:Initialization Test: Check if the queue initializes correctly.Push Test: Check if data is being pushed correctly.Pop Test: Check if data is being popped correctly.Thread Safety Test: Use multiple threads to push and pop simultaneously and ensure the queue's behavior is correct.Here's a basic setup for the tests:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note:The thread safety test is rudimentary. To truly test the thread safety, you'd want to use more threads, more pushes/pops, and some kind of validation that the final state is what you expect.Ensure you have error checks for all pthread function calls. They're omitted for simplicity here.This test setup assumes your queue implementation is correct. If the tests fail, you'd need to look into the implementation or the tests to determine the issue.
