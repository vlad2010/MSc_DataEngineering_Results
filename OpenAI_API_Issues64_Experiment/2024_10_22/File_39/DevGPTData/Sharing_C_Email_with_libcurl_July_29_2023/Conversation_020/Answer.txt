ChatGPTIf the body of the email message is not being printed in the verbose output, it might be due to the way libcurl handles the data sent in the request. By default, libcurl uses the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback to provide the data to be sent in the request body. In the provided C++ code, the email data is provided through this callback by reading from the email_data string.To print the body of the email message in the verbose output, you can add custom debug information in the read_data_callback function, which is the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback. Modify the read_data_callback function as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this modification, the read_data_callback function will now print the content of the email body being sent to the SMTP server. This will allow you to see the body of the email in the verbose output.Remember that verbose output can be extensive, especially for large email bodies. If you are handling sensitive information, be cautious about enabling verbose output in a production environment or when dealing with production data.After making the modification, execute the program again and check the verbose output for the printed body of the email message. If you still encounter any issues or need further assistance, please feel free to share the updated verbose output, and I'll be glad to help.
