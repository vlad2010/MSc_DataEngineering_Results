ChatGPTSure! We can avoid using a global variable for the email contents by passing the necessary data to the read_data_callback function through the userptr parameter. Here's the modified code to achieve this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this modified version, we removed the global variable payload_text and declared it directly inside the main function. The email content is then passed to the read_data_callback function through the EmailData struct, which contains both the email data and the necessary information for the callback to read the data properly. This way, we avoid using a global variable for the email contents while ensuring the necessary data is accessible throughout the libcurl request.
