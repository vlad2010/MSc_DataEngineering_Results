ChatGPTThank you for providing the verbose output. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the SSL connection is being established successfully. However, the server responded with a 530 5.7.0 Must issue a STARTTLS command first error. This indicates that the server is expecting a STARTTLS command to upgrade the connection to a secure one before authentication.The issue seems to be related to Gmail's SMTP server configuration, which requires using STARTTLS for secure connections. We need to explicitly send the STARTTLS command to initiate the upgrade.Here's the updated C++ code to include the STARTTLS command:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Now, the code sets the CURLOPT_USE_TLS option to CURLUSESSL_TRY, which should initiate the STARTTLS command and allow the email to be sent successfully using Gmail's SMTP server.
