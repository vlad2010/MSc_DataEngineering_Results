ChatGPTYou're correct, handling diagonal collisions requires additional considerations. In diagonal collisions, the collision normal is not aligned with just the x-axis or the y-axis. Instead, it is a combination of both x and y components.To handle diagonal collisions, you need to calculate the collision normal vector based on the collision direction. Here's an updated example that includes diagonal collision handling:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated example, I've introduced a Normalize() function that normalizes a given vector by dividing its components by its length. This function is used to normalize the collision normal vector.After calculating the collision normal based on the collision direction, we reflect the velocities of the objects using the normalized collision normal.Note that this example assumes a collision from top-left to bottom-right, but you can adjust the collisionDirection vector accordingly to handle different diagonal collision scenarios.By normalizing the collision normal vector, you ensure that the resulting reflection maintains the overall speed and direction of the objects while changing their movement direction appropriately for diagonal collisions.
