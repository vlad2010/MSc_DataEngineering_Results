ChatGPTIn C, you can use curly braces ({}) to initialize an array during declaration. Here's an example of how to bracket initialize an array in C:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, an array named numbers is declared and initialized with the values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} using curly braces during declaration. The size of the array is automatically determined based on the number of elements provided.You can access the elements of the array using indexing, as shown in the for loop. The loop iterates over each element of the array and prints its value.Note that this method of initialization is available only during array declaration. If you want to initialize an array at a later point, you need to assign values to individual array elements using indexing or by using a loop.
