ChatGPTCertainly! If you prefer using if statements to handle different collision scenarios, here's an example that demonstrates how you can change the direction of movement based on the direction of collision:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, we use if statements to check the direction of the collision based on the collisionDirection vector. Depending on the direction of collision, we reflect the velocities of the objects using the appropriate reflection vectors.If the collisionDirection.x is less than zero, it indicates a collision from left to right, so we reflect the velocities along the negative x-axis. If it is greater than zero, it indicates a collision from right to left, so we reflect the velocities along the positive x-axis. Similarly, if collisionDirection.y is less than zero, it indicates a collision from top to
