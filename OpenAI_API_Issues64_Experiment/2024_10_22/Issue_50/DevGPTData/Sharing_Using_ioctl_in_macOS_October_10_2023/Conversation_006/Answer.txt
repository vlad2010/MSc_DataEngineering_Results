ChatGPTCertainly! Here's a version of the code rewritten in C++ using the Carbon framework for macOS:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This C++ version retains the functionality of the original Objective-C code. It sets up an event tap to monitor right-click events and exits the application if the right-click is held for 1 second. Please note that this code will work on macOS and assumes you have the necessary framework (Carbon) linked in your project.
