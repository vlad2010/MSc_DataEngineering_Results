ChatGPTThe code you provided is an Objective-C program that creates a macOS application called "Keyboard Cleaner" that hides the cursor and disables keyboard input while displaying a message to the user. The part of the code that effectively "blocks" keyboard input is not related to traditional keyboard input blocking but rather relies on creating an event tap and monitoring right-click events for a specific duration to exit the application.Here's the relevant part of the code responsible for this behavior:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Here's how it works:The tapCallback function is registered as an event tap using CGEventTapCreate. It monitors all events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) in the system.When a right mouse button event occurs, it records the timestamp when the button was pressed (kCGEventRightMouseDown) and checks when it is released (kCGEventRightMouseUp).If the right mouse button is held for more than 1 second (as determined by the timestamp comparison), it calls exit(0) to terminate the application, effectively "blocking" keyboard input and exiting the application.The tap method sets up the event tap and associated event handling.Please note that this approach doesn't truly block keyboard input globally for the entire system but only for the application itself. It relies on monitoring mouse events to exit the application when a specific condition is met. Keyboard input outside of this application would not be affected.
