ChatGPTI apologize for the oversight. The InitializeEventQueue function I mentioned in my previous response is not part of the public macOS API, and there isn't a direct API to globally block keyboard input for all applications on macOS.To clarify, macOS does not provide a straightforward way for a regular user-space application to globally block keyboard input across the entire system. Such functionality would typically require deep system-level access, which is not feasible for regular applications.If you have specific requirements or use cases for blocking keyboard input, please provide more details, and I can offer alternative suggestions or solutions based on your needs.
