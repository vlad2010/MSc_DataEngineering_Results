ChatGPTCertainly, no worries! I'll update the register from HUSB238_PD_STATUS0 to HUSB238_PD_STATUS1 in each of the functions we've written so far. Here are the updated functions:Function to get the "attached" status[CODE_BLOCK_0]Function to get the "CC_DIR" status[CODE_BLOCK_1]Function to get the PD response codes[CODE_BLOCK_2]Function to get the 5V contract voltage status[CODE_BLOCK_3]Function to get the 5V current contract[CODE_BLOCK_4]Each function now accesses HUSB238_PD_STATUS1 instead of HUSB238_PD_STATUS0. Let me know if this is what you needed!
