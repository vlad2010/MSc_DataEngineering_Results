ChatGPTIn C++, access modifiers (public, private, and protected) are also used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members. Let's see how they work in C++ with the same practical examples as before:Public Modifier:
Members declared as public in C++ are accessible from anywhere, including outside the class and its subclasses.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this C++ example, the "brand" variable and the "start()" method are declared as public within the "Car" class. The "main" function, which is outside the class, can directly access and modify the "brand" variable and call the "start()" method.Private Modifier:
Members declared as private in C++ are only accessible within the same class where they are declared. They are not accessible from outside the class, including subclasses.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In this C++ example, the "balance" variable and the "deductFees()" method are declared as private within the "BankAccount" class. The "main" function, which is outside the class, cannot directly access the "balance" variable or call the "deductFees()" method. Instead, it can interact with the class through the public methods like "deposit()" and "getBalance()".Protected Modifier:
Members declared as protected in C++ are accessible within the same class, its subclasses, and other classes within the same package (as C++ doesn't have a strict notion of packages).Example:[CODE_BLOCK_2]In this C++ example, the "name" variable and the "makeSound()" method in the "Animal" class are declared as protected. The "Dog" class, which is a subclass of "Animal," can access these protected members directly. The "main" function, which is outside the subclass, cannot access the protected method directly, but it can access it indirectly through the public method "greet()" in the "Dog" class.To summarize, C++ access modifiers work similarly to those in Java. Public allows unrestricted access, private restricts access to the same class, and protected allows access within the same class and its subclasses. Choosing the appropriate access modifier in C++ is crucial for maintaining proper data hiding and ensuring the security and maintainability of the code.
