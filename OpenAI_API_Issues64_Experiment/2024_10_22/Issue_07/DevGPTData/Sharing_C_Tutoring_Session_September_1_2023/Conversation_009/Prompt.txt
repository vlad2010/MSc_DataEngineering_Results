Im helping a student understand his homework, but I'm not familiar with C++ at all.

I have a file called hwk1.cpp with the following code. Please help me make sense out of this and connect it in a way where i can start testing results or logic easily.

#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include "student.h"
#include "bubble.h"

int main()
{
    // std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}


done
