ChatGPTUpon reviewing Code - 2 again, it appears to be the same as the previous one, with some additional comments and preprocessing directives for file input/output. As such, the analysis remains the same. Let's summarize the comparison between Code - 1 and Code - 2:Time Complexity:Code - 1: O(tt * n), where tt is the number of test cases and n is the size of the vector in each test case.Code - 2: O(t * n), where t is the number of test cases and n is the size of the vector in each test case.Space Complexity:Code - 1: O(1) - constant extra space for variables.Code - 2: O(n) - space for the vector v of size n.Other Aspects:Both codes are logically equivalent and achieve the same result.Code - 2 uses some macro definitions to simplify the code and makes use of a solve() function for each test case, which might be more convenient in larger programs.Conclusion:Code - 2 is still better in terms of time complexity, as it has a linear time complexity O(t * n), whereas Code - 1 has a higher time complexity O(tt * n) due to the presence of an additional outer loop for test cases.In terms of space complexity, Code - 1 is better, as it uses constant extra space O(1), while Code - 2 uses additional space for the vector v, resulting in space complexity O(n).The choice between the two codes depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem. If the number of test cases (tt or t) is relatively small and memory usage is a concern, then Code - 1 might be preferable. On the other hand, if the number of test cases is larger and readability and code organization are important, then Code - 2 might be more convenient with its solve() function and macro definitions.
