ChatGPTAlright, let's break it down. The MainWindow class is typically defined in a header file (mainwindow.h), and its methods are implemented in a source file (mainwindow.cpp). The main.cpp file is where the application starts running.Here's an example of what the mainwindow.h file could look like:[CODE_BLOCK_0]And here's what the mainwindow.cpp file could look like:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This MainWindow creates a layout with two QCustomPlot objects, one for ECG data and one for heart rate data, and starts reading data from the serial port.And finally, in your main.cpp file, you create a QApplication object and a MainWindow object, and start the application's event loop:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Please note that you may need to adjust this code to fit into your actual codebase and coding style. This is a simple example to demonstrate how you might structure your application and use these classes. The actual implementation can be more complex, especially in larger applications.
