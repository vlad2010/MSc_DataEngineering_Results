ChatGPTIf you're making changes to your source files and they're not being reflected in your running application, there are a few things you might want to check:Ensure that you're saving your changes. This may seem obvious, but it's easy to forget to save after making changes, especially if you're used to IDEs that auto-save your work.Try a clean build. Sometimes old build artifacts can interfere with the new build. Go to the "Build" menu in Qt Creator, select "Clean All", then "Run qmake", and finally "Build All". This will clear out the old build artifacts and fully rebuild your project.Check your project configuration. Make sure that your .pro file (Qt Project file) includes all the source files (.cpp) and header files (.h) you are using.Make sure you're editing the right files. Especially if your project includes many files or if you have multiple instances of Qt Creator open, you might accidentally be editing the wrong file.Check for compilation errors. If there are errors during the build process, the application may be running the last successful build rather than your latest changes. Ensure there are no errors in the "Issues" tab of Qt Creator.If none of these resolve the issue, there may be a more complex problem related to your specific setup, and additional debugging information would be required.
