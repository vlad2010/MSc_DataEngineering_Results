ChatGPTSure, I will compile all the changes that need to be made to your mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp for the heart rate plot label feature:mainwindow.h[CODE_BLOCK_0]mainwindow.cpp[CODE_BLOCK_1]With these changes, the latest data point on the heart rate plot should be labeled with the corresponding heart rate value. Remember that QCPItemText is part of the QCustomPlot library and it should be included in the header file path you used when you included QCustomPlot in your project. If you're still encountering problems, ensure your QCustomPlot version supports QCPItemText and that you've included it correctly.
