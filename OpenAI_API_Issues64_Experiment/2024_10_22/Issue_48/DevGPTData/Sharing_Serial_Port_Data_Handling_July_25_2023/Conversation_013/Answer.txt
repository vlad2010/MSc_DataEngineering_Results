ChatGPTYes, I can guide you to display the latest heart rate reading. We will add a QLabel to the GUI which will display the latest heart rate. Here is how you can do it:Add the QLabel to the UI. If you are using the designer, you can just drag and drop a label wherever you like it. Let's assume that the label's object name is latestHeartRateLabel. If you're writing the UI manually, you can add the QLabel in MainWindow's constructor like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Update the QLabel each time new heart rate data is received. You can do this in the addHeartRateData() method:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Now the latest heart rate reading will be displayed in the label each time new heart rate data is received. Adjust the placement of the QLabel as desired.
