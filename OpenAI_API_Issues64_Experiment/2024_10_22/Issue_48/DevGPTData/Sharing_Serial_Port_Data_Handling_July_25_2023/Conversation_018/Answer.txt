ChatGPTI apologize for the confusion. Indeed, there is no method named addItem() in the QCustomPlot class, it was my mistake. Instead, to create an item and add it to a plot, you can simply use new and pass the QCustomPlot instance (heartRatePlot in this case) as the parent.To add a QCPItemText to heartRatePlot, you can modify the MainWindow constructor like so:[CODE_BLOCK_0]And then in addHeartRateData():[CODE_BLOCK_1]The setType(QCPItemPosition::ptPlotCoords) line is crucial because it sets the coordinate type of the QCPItemText object to ptPlotCoords, which means the coordinates you set with setCoords() will be interpreted as plot coordinates, and the label will move when you pan or zoom the plot.
