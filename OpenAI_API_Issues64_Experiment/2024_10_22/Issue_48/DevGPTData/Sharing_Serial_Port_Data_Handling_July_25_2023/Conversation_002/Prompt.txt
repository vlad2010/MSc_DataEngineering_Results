The serial port will receive data at 360 Hz. It will always be of the form "A(,B)\r\n", where `A` is a signed integer representing an ECG signal sampled at 360 Hz and `B` is an unsigned integer representing a heartrate reading in units of bpm (beats per minute). Note that `B` is not always sent; when there is no reading available, the serial port receives `A\r\n` and when there is a heartrate reading the serial port receives `B\r\n`. I would like a plot for the ECG signal and a separate line graph for the heartrate readings.
