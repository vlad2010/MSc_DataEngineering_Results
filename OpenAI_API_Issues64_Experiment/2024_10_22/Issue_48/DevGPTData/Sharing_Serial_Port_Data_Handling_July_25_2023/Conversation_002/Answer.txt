ChatGPTAlright. We'll start by modifying the SerialPortReader class to handle this specific format of data. We'll parse each line received from the serial port, splitting the line into ECG signal value and heartrate if they both exist.The serial port might not always send us complete lines with each read operation, so we'll need to buffer incoming data until we receive a complete line.Modify your SerialPortReader class as follows:Add the following to your serialportreader.h:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Replace the handleReadyRead() function in your serialportreader.cpp:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This code reads all available data from the serial port and appends it to the m_readData buffer. Then it processes each line in the buffer that's complete (i.e., ends with '\n'). Each line is split on the comma (',') character, and if there are two parts, it emits both the ECG signal and the heartrate, otherwise it emits only the ECG signal.Now, let's move to the plotting part.The QCustomPlot library is a powerful, easy-to-use plotting library. Here is a simplified example of how you could use it to create two separate line graphs for the ECG data and the heart rate data, in your main widget. Note that you will need to adapt this to your specific needs.Include necessary headers:[CODE_BLOCK_2]In your main widget class, define two QCustomPlot objects and a SerialPortReader object, connect the newData signals from SerialPortReader to new slots in your widget class, and in those slots, update the data for the corresponding graphs and replot:[CODE_BLOCK_3]You'll have to initialize the SerialPortReader and the plots in your widget's constructor, and start reading from the serial port:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Now, let's implement the addECGData and addHeartRateData slots. We'll add the new data point at the end of the data array, remove the first point if there are more than 360 points (to keep only the last 1 second of data), and update the plot:[CODE_BLOCK_5]Remember that this is a very simplified example, and there's a lot more you can do with QCustomPlot, such as setting custom axis labels and ranges, enabling user interaction, etc. Check the QCustomPlot documentation for more information.
