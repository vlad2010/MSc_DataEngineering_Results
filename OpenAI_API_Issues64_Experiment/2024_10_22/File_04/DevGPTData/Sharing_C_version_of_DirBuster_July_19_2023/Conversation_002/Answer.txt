A popular source for wordlists is the "SecLists" project on GitHub, which contains a large collection of wordlists for various purposes, including directory and file brute-forcing.You can clone the SecLists repository using the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Once cloned, you can find wordlists specifically designed for directory and file enumeration under the SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content directory. Some commonly used wordlists in this directory include:common.txt: A list of common directories and filenames.big.txt: A larger list of directories and filenames.raft-large-directories.txt and raft-large-files.txt: Large wordlists for directory and file enumeration.apache.txt, iis.txt, nginx.txt: Wordlists for specific web server software.You can use any of these wordlists as input to the simple DirBuster program. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Keep in mind that the provided C implementation of DirBuster is basic and may not be as efficient or feature-rich as the original DirBuster tool. Using large wordlists may lead to longer execution times and higher resource usage.
