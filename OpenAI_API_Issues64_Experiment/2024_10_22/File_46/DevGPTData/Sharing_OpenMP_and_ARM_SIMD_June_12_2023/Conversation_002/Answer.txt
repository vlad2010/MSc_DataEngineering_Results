ChatGPTSure, here is a simple C program that performs a dot product of two large vectors:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This program first allocates two arrays of doubles of size SIZE (1,000,000 in this example) and initializes them with some values. It then calls the dot_product function to calculate the dot product of the two arrays and prints the result.Remember to compile and run the program in an environment that supports C, and to deal with any compilation issues that may arise due to environment or compiler differences.
