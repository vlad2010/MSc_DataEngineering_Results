ChatGPTApologies for the confusion caused. Upon double-checking, I realized that the function xmlXPathRegisterNs does not exist in the libxml2 library.To register namespaces in XPath expressions using libxml2, you can use the xmlXPathRegisterNsFunc function instead. Here's the updated code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the updated code, xmlXPathRegisterNsFunc is used instead of xmlXPathRegisterNs. This should resolve the issue with the "xmlXPathRegisterNs" identifier not being declared.Please give it a try, and the program should compile and run without any errors related to "xmlXPathRegisterNs".
