ChatGPTApologies for the oversight in my previous response. You are correct. In addition to installing the libxml2 library, you need to add a link to it during the compilation process.To compile the program with both libcurl and libxml2, you can use the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The -lcurl flag links against the libcurl library, and the -lxml2 flag links against the libxml2 library. This ensures that the necessary library functions are available during compilation.Make sure you have both libraries (libcurl and libxml2) installed on your system before attempting to compile the program.
