ChatGPTCertainly! Here's an example of a C++ program that uses the libcurl library to scrape a list of bank holidays in a given country and year from https://www.officeholidays.com/:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Before you can compile and run this program, make sure you have the libcurl library installed on your system. You can install it using the package manager of your operating system (e.g., sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev on Ubuntu).This program prompts the user to enter a country code (e.g., us, uk) and a year. It then constructs the URL by concatenating the country code and year to the base URL. The libcurl library is used to perform the HTTP request and retrieve the HTML content of the webpage. The fetched data is stored in a string and printed to the console.Please note that web scraping can be subject to legal and ethical considerations, so make sure you comply with the website's terms of service and use the program responsibly.
