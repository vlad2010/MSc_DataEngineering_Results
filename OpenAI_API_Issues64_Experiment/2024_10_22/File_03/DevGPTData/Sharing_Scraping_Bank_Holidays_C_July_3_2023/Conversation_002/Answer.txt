ChatGPTTo compile the C++ program using gcc in Linux, you need to use g++ instead of gcc because g++ is the compiler for C++ programs. Here are the steps to compile the program:Open a terminal.Navigate to the directory where your C++ source code file is located using the cd command. For example, if your source code file is named "scrape.cpp" and is located in the "Documents" directory, you can use the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Once you are in the correct directory, compile the program using the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This command tells g++ to compile the "scrape.cpp" source code file and generate an executable named "scrape". The -lcurl option is used to link against the libcurl library.If there are no errors in your code, the compilation process should complete without any issues. If there are errors, you will see error messages in the terminal.If the compilation is successful, you can run the program by executing the generated executable:[CODE_BLOCK_2]That's it! You should now be able to compile and run the C++ program using g++ in Linux.
