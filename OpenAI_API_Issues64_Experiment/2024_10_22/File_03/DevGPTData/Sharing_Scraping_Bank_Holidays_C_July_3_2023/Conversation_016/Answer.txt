ChatGPTThe error pointing to the line for (int i = 0; i < nodes->nodeNr; ++i) suggests that there may be an issue with accessing or iterating over the nodes object. This error typically occurs when the nodes object is not properly initialized or is NULL.To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:Verify that the XPath expression used to query the HTML document is correct. Ensure that it matches the structure of the HTML content and returns the expected nodes.Ensure that the xmlXPathEvalExpression function call is successful and returns a valid xmlXPathObjectPtr object. You can add some debug output to check the return value of this function call:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This will help you determine if there are any issues with evaluating the XPath expression.Make sure that the nodes object is not NULL before attempting to access its properties. You can add a check to ensure it is valid before entering the loop:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will prevent the loop from being executed if the nodes object is NULL.By applying these steps, you should be able to identify the cause of the segmentation fault and resolve the issue.
