ChatGPTCertainly! To read a single bit from a register, you can use the Adafruit_I2CRegisterBit class, similar to what we did in the getAttached() and getCCStatus() functions.Here's how get5VContractV() could look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, an Adafruit_I2CRegisterBit object is initialized to read the 2nd bit (bit index 2) from the PD_STATUS0 register. The function then directly returns the result of the read() method, which will be a boolean value.Does this meet your requirements?
