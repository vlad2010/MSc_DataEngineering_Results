ChatGPTCertainly! Let's write a function to get the PD_SRC_CURRENT value from the HUSB238_PD_STATUS0 register. This function will read the bottom four bits (bits 0 to 3) and return a value of the HUSB238_CurrentSetting enum type.Here's how the function could look:Function to get the PD_SRC_CURRENT[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits is used to read 4 bits starting from the 0th bit (bit index 0). The value is then cast to the HUSB238_CurrentSetting enum type and returned.Does this implementation meet your requirements?
