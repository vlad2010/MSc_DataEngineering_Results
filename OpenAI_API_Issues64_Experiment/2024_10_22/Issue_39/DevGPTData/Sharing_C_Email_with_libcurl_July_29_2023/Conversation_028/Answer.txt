ChatGPTI apologize for the inconvenience earlier. I'm glad to hear that the updated code worked for you!Your modified program looks correct, and it should successfully send the email using libcurl with the custom message in the request body. The use of the payload_source function as the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback and the upload_status struct to keep track of the data being sent are essential for sending the email content as the request body.Additionally, the debug_callback function is an excellent addition to print the libcurl debug information to the console.If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask. Happy coding!
