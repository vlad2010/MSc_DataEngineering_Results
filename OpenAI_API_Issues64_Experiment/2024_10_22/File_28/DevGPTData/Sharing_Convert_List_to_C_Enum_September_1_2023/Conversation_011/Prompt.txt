great for this enum you made earlier:
typedef enum _husb_currents {
    CURRENT_0_5_A = 0b0000,
    CURRENT_0_7_A = 0b0001,
    CURRENT_1_0_A = 0b0010,
    CURRENT_1_25_A = 0b0011,
    CURRENT_1_5_A = 0b0100,
    CURRENT_1_75_A = 0b0101,
    CURRENT_2_0_A = 0b0110,
    CURRENT_2_25_A = 0b0111,
    CURRENT_2_50_A = 0b1000,
    CURRENT_2_75_A = 0b1001,
    CURRENT_3_0_A = 0b1010,
    CURRENT_3_25_A = 0b1011,
    CURRENT_3_5_A = 0b1100,
    CURRENT_4_0_A = 0b1101,
    CURRENT_4_5_A = 0b1110,
    CURRENT_5_0_A = 0b1111
} HUSB238_CurrentSetting;
please add doxygen comments on each line in ///< format. the comment just needs to be the current value, which is 0.5A through 5.0A
