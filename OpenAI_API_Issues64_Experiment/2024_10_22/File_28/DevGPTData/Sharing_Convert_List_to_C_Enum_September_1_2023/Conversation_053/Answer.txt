ChatGPTI apologize for the confusion. Thank you for clarifying. Here's the corrected implementation for the getSourceCapabilities function:Function to get source capabilities[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this corrected function, an Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits object is used to access the bottom 5 bits (bit indexes 0 to 4) of the GO_COMMAND register. We then write 0b00100 to those bits to request source capabilities.I apologize for any confusion earlier. Does this function now meet your requirements?
