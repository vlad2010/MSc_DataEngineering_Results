ChatGPTCertainly! The function isVoltageDetected will take an argument of type HUSB238_PDOSelection to check if a specific voltage (defined by the Power Data Object, PDO) is detected. This function will likely need to read from a specific register and bit range to determine this information.Since I don't have the exact details of which register and bits correspond to the PDO voltage detection, I'll provide a generic outline of what the function could look like:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Could you provide more details on which register and bits should be read to determine the voltage detection based on PDO? Then, I can give you a more specific implementation.
