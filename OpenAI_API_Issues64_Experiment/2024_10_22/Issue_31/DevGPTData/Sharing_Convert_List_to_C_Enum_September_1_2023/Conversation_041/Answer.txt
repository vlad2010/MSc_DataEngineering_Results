ChatGPTGreat, let's start by writing a function to get the PD_SRC_VOLTAGE value from the HUSB238_PD_STATUS0 register. This function will read bits 4 to 7 and return a value of the HUSB238_VoltageSetting enum type.Here's how the function could look:Function to get the PD_SRC_VOLTAGE[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits is used to read 4 bits starting from the 4th bit (bit index 4). The value is then cast to the HUSB238_VoltageSetting enum type and returned.Does this look good to you?
