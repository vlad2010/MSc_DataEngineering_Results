ChatGPTCreating an Arduino library in the style of Limor Fried (Ladyada) from Adafruit is a great idea! Adafruit libraries are known for their user-friendliness, detailed comments, and ease of use. Here's what we'll do:Define the header file (.h) with the necessary class definition and function prototypes.Implement the methods in a source file (.cpp).Include example code to demonstrate the usage of the library.Let's start with the header file. I'll include the enums we've created earlier along with a class definition. What would you like to name the class for this Arduino library?
