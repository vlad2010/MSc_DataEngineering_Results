ChatGPTApologies for any confusion. You are correct; I apologize for my oversight in my previous response. Upon closer inspection, I noticed an issue in the way the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback is being set.The CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback is used when libcurl needs to read data from the application (your code) and send it as the request body. However, in your current code, you are passing the email_data string directly to CURLOPT_READDATA, which is not the correct way to provide the data for the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback.To properly handle the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback, you should create a separate structure that holds the necessary information, including the email_data string, and pass a pointer to this structure as the CURLOPT_READDATA.Here's how you can modify the code to fix this issue:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With these changes, the read_data_callback function should be called correctly, and you should see the debug printout for the body of the email being sent. The EmailData structure is now used to hold the necessary data for the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback.Please try these modifications and run the program again. You should now see the custom debug printout for the email body, and it should be triggered properly. If you encounter any further issues or have more questions, feel free to let me know, and I'll be glad to assist you further.
