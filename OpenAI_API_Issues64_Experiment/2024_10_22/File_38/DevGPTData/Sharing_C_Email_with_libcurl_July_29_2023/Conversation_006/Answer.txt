ChatGPTIt appears that the curl command you provided executed successfully and sent the email. The output you provided indicates that the command was able to upload the email data to the SMTP server (Total 100% Uploaded) without any errors.If you were looking for an equivalent C++ code using cpp-httplib to achieve the same result, you can refer to the code I provided in my previous response. The cpp-httplib code should also be able to send the email using Gmail's SMTP server when properly configured.
