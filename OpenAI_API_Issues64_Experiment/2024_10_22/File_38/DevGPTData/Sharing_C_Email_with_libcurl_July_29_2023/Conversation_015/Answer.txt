ChatGPTI apologize for the inconvenience. If the recipient email address did not receive the email, there might be some issues with the delivery process. Here are some potential reasons and troubleshooting steps you can try:Check Spam/Junk Folder: The email might have been filtered to the recipient's spam or junk folder. Ask the recipient to check those folders as well.Gmail Account Configuration: If the recipient's email address is a Gmail account, ensure that the Gmail account settings are properly configured to receive emails.Authentication Error: Double-check that the email address and password used for authentication (username and password) are correct. Make sure there are no leading/trailing spaces or special characters in the secret file.Firewall or Antivirus Blocking: Check if any firewall or antivirus software on the sender's machine is blocking the email sending process.Verify STARTTLS Support: Make sure that the SMTP server supports STARTTLS. Although Gmail's SMTP server supports both SSL/TLS and STARTTLS, some SMTP servers might only support SSL/TLS on port 465.Enable Less Secure Apps (Gmail): If you are using a Gmail account as the sender, check if "Less Secure Apps" is enabled in the Gmail account settings. It allows non-Google apps to access the Gmail account.Check libcurl Version: Ensure that you are using a version of libcurl that supports TLS 1.3.Debugging Output: If possible, capture the full verbose output for further analysis. This might provide additional insights into the issue.If you have tried these troubleshooting steps and the issue persists, please share the full verbose output, and I'll do my best to assist you further.
