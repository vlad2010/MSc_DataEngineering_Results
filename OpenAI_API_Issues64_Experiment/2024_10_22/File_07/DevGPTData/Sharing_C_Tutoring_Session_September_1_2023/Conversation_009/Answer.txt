ChatGPTAlright, you've shared a decent amount of information. Let's connect the dots and get you and your student up to speed on this C++ homework.The Files and Their Roles:grades: This is an executable file that contains student names and their exam scores.student.h: This header file defines the student structure, which includes first and last names, scores for three exams, and the mean of those scores.bubble.h: This header file declares the prototype for the bubble function, which sorts an array of student pointers based on the mean field.bubble.cpp: This source file contains the implementation for the bubble function.hwk1.cpp: This is the main source file where everything is supposed to come together. Currently, it's empty except for some #include directives.How They Connect:student.h is included in bubble.cpp, so the bubble function knows what a student is.bubble.h is included in hwk1.cpp, so the main() function will be able to call the bubble function.To Get Things Rolling:Read Data: First, you need to read the student data from the grades file into an array or vector of student structs in hwk1.cpp.Sort Data: Once the data is read, you can call the bubble function to sort the students based on their mean scores.Display Data: After sorting, you could print the sorted list to the console to check if everything is working as expected.Here's a simplified example of how your hwk1.cpp might look after adding these functionalities:[CODE_BLOCK_0]I hope this helps you and your student get a better understanding of how these files and their functionalities are interconnected. Given that you're working with education and frontier technologies, having a grasp of basic programming concepts can be incredibly beneficial. Feel free to ask more if you need further clarification.
