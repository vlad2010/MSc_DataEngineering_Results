ChatGPTWhen you send a packet from a socket bound to a specific IP address, the operating system does not duplicate the packet on all interfaces with that IP address. Instead, it uses the routing table to determine the best interface to use for sending the packet.The routing table contains a list of IP networks and the associated network interface to use when sending packets to each network. The decision is generally based on the destination IP address of the packet. The system will look up the destination in the routing table and use the associated interface.If the destination IP address is on the same subnet as one of the network interfaces, the system will use that interface to send the packet. If the destination is not on the same subnet as any of the network interfaces, the system will use the default gateway setting in the routing table.So, even if you have multiple interfaces with the same IP address, when you send a packet from a socket bound to that IP address, the system does not duplicate the packet or choose an interface at random. It makes a decision based on the routing table.Keep in mind that the routing behavior can be quite complex and is affected by multiple factors, including the system's network configuration and the specifics of the network topology. This is a simplified explanation and actual behavior can vary depending on specific configurations and circumstances.
