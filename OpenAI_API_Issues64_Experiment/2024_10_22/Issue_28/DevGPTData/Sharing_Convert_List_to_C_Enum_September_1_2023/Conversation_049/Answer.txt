ChatGPTCertainly! The selectPDO function will set bits 4 to 7 of the PDO_SELECT register based on the given HUSB238_PDOSelection enum value. Meanwhile, the getSelectedPDO function will read the same bits from the PDO_SELECT register and return the corresponding HUSB238_PDOSelection value.Here's how you could implement these functions:Function to set the selected PDO[CODE_BLOCK_0]Function to get the selected PDO[CODE_BLOCK_1]In both functions, Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits is used to manipulate bits 4 to 7 (bit indexes 4 to 7) of the PDO_SELECT register. The selectPDO function writes the bits based on the argument passed in, while getSelectedPDO reads the bits and returns the corresponding HUSB238_PDOSelection value.Do these functions look good to you?
