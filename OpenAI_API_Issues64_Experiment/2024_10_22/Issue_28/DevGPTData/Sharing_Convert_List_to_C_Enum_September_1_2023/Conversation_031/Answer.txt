ChatGPTGreat! To read a range of bits from a register, you can use the Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits class from the Adafruit_BusIO library. This class allows you to read or write multiple bits within a register.Here's how the getPDResponse() function might look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code:The Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits constructor takes four arguments:A pointer to the Adafruit_I2CRegister object that represents the register.The number of bits you want to read (3 bits in this case).The starting bit position (3rd bit).The ending bit position (5th bit).The read() function then reads those specific bits from the register and returns their value as a single uint8_t.Does this implementation meet your requirements?
