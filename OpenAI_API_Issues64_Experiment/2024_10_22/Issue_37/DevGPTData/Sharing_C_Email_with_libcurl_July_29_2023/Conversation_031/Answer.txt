ChatGPTYes, that's correct. The missing line curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L); in the previous code was the main issue that prevented the email content from being sent correctly in the request body.By setting the CURLOPT_UPLOAD option to 1L, you explicitly instruct libcurl to treat the request as an upload operation. This is essential when you want to provide custom data in the request body using the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback.Without this option being set, libcurl interprets the request as a regular HTTP POST request with a Content-Type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and it doesn't use the custom payload provided by the callback function. As a result, the email content was not being sent properly, leading to the previous issues.By adding curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);, the modified code instructs libcurl to use the data provided by the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback as the request body, and this ensures that the email content is sent correctly, and the email can be delivered successfully.Additionally, in the modified code, the use of the EmailData struct to pass the necessary information to the callback function is a good practice, and it helps avoid using a global variable for the email contents.So, the main fix was adding the line curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);, but the usage of the EmailData struct for the callback data and other improvements in the modified code make it more robust and maintainable.
