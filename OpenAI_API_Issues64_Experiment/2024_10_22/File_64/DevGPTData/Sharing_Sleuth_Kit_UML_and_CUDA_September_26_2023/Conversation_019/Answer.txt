ChatGPTIndeed, atomic operations can have a performance impact due to the serialization they introduce, so itâ€™s often good to minimize their use when possible. Given this, using cudaDeviceSynchronize() for synchronization and then analyzing the results on the host side can be a good approach here to avoid the need for atomic operations.Host Side Logic:Here is a simplified host-side logic that launches the kernel and processes the results:Allocate Memory on Device: Allocate memory on the device for the array, found flag, and direction array.Copy Data to Device: Copy the array and initial values of the found flag and direction array to the device.Launch Kernel: Launch the kernel with an appropriate number of blocks and threads.Synchronize: Wait for all threads to finish using cudaDeviceSynchronize().Copy Results back to Host: Copy the found flag and direction array back to the host.Process Results: Analyze the direction array to decide the new range or conclude the search.Here's an illustrative example in C++:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, h_array is the host array, d_array is the device array, h_found and d_found are the host and device found flags respectively, and h_direction and d_direction are the host and device direction arrays respectively.Would you like any modifications or should we finalize this and discuss the testing strategy?
