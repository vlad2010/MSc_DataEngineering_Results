yes lets take a closer look starting with hdb_binsrch_lookup_str() in which the actual binary search starts around ```// Do a lookup in the index of the index file. The index of the index file is
    // a mapping of the first three digits of a hash to the offset in the index
    // file of the first index entry of the possibly empty set of index entries 
    // for hashes with those initial digits.
    if (hdb_binsrch_info->idx_offsets) {
        // Convert the initial hash digits into an index into the index offsets.
        // This will give the offset into the index file for the set of hashes
        // that contains the sought hash.
        char digits[4];
        strncpy(digits, ucHash, 3);
        digits[3] = '\0';
        long int idx_idx_off = strtol(digits, NULL, 16);
        if ((idx_idx_off < 0) || (idx_idx_off > (long int)IDX_IDX_ENTRY_COUNT)) {
            tsk_release_lock(&hdb_binsrch_info->base.lock);
            tsk_error_reset();
            tsk_error_set_errno(TSK_ERR_HDB_ARG);
            tsk_error_set_errstr(
                "%s: error finding index in secondary index for %s", func_name, ucHash);
            return -1;
        }

        // Determine the bounds for the binary search of the sorted index file.
        // The lower bound is the start of the set of entries that may contain
        // the sought hash. The upper bound is the offset one past the end
        // of that entry set, or EOF.
        low = hdb_binsrch_info->idx_offsets[idx_idx_off];
        if (IDX_IDX_ENTRY_NOT_SET != (uint64_t)low) {
            do {
                ++idx_idx_off;
                if (idx_idx_off == (long int)IDX_IDX_ENTRY_COUNT) {
                    // The set of hashes to search is the last set. Use the end of the index
                    // file as the upper bound for the binary search.
                    up = hdb_binsrch_info->idx_size;
                    break;
                }
                else {
                    up = hdb_binsrch_info->idx_offsets[idx_idx_off];
                }
            } while (IDX_IDX_ENTRY_NOT_SET == (uint64_t)up);
        }
        else {
            // Quick out - the hash does not map to an index offset.
            // It is not in the hash database.
            return 0;
        }
    }
    else {
        // There is no index for the index file. Search the entire file.
        low = hdb_binsrch_info->idx_off;
        up = hdb_binsrch_info->idx_size;
    }``` right?  While you are doing your analysis make sure you explain to me what the code is doing, it's well commented but your comments might help.  And focus on getting this part right first: `    Functionality: The binary search operations in functions like hdb_binsrch_lookup_str can be parallelized by employing multiple threads to search different segments of the sorted index array concurrently.
    Approach: Divide the sorted index array into segments and assign each segment to a different thread for searching. This approach is especially beneficial when multiple keys need to be searched in the index, as it can significantly reduce the overall search time.`
