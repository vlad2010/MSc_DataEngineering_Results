ChatGPTI understand your concern. Here are the changes you need to make in your code:Modify the FootballProcessor Constructor: In the FootballProcessor constructor, create a copy of the original teams and use that copy for processing while keeping the original teams unchanged.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Create a Method to Reset Statistics: Create a private method within FootballProcessor to reset the statistics (goals, points, streaks) of the working copy of Team objects.[CODE_BLOCK_1]Call ResetTeamStatistics Before Processing a Round: In the ProcessRoundResults method, before processing a new round of matches, call the ResetTeamStatistics method to reset the statistics of the working copy of Team objects while keeping the original Team objects unchanged.[CODE_BLOCK_2]These changes will ensure that you maintain the original Team objects intact while resetting the statistics for each new round of matches. The statistics will be updated only for the working copy of Team objects, and the streaks won't reset when you load a new match.
