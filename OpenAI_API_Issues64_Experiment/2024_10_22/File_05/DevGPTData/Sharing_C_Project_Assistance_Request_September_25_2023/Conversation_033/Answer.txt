ChatGPTThank you for the clarification. If the points and other statistics are being updated correctly but the issue is specifically with counting wins, draws, and losses, it's likely related to how these values are calculated and tracked within your code. To help you further, I would like to see the relevant parts of your code where wins, draws, and losses are calculated and updated. Please provide the code snippets or functions responsible for this calculation.Additionally, if you have any specific logic or formulas in your code related to calculating wins, draws, and losses, it would be helpful to see those as well. This will allow me to review the code and provide more specific guidance on resolving the issue.
