ChatGPTIf you've renamed the round files to "round-01.csv," and you still encounter issues with the streak calculations, it's unlikely that the filename itself is causing the problem. However, it's essential to ensure that the content and format of the new round files are correct.Here are some additional steps to help you troubleshoot the issue:Validate Round Files: Double-check the content and formatting of the "round-01.csv" file and any other round files you're using for simulation. Ensure that the team abbreviations, match results, and other data are correctly structured. Any inconsistencies or errors in the data could impact streak calculations.Debugging: Add debugging statements or log messages within your code to trace the execution and identify where the streak calculations might be going wrong. Specifically, you can log the values of variables related to streaks before and after calculations to see how they change during the simulation.Process Single Round: Instead of simulating all matches at once, try processing a single round using "round-01.csv" and manually verify that the streak calculations work as expected for that round. This can help narrow down the issue to a specific round or part of your code.Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and validation within your code to handle unexpected data or issues gracefully. This can prevent the entire process from breaking due to minor data problems in one round.Check Logic Flow: Review the logic flow in your code, especially when processing multiple rounds in succession. Ensure that there are no unintended side effects or shared variables that could interfere with streak calculations between rounds.Inspect Data Changes: Verify that there are no changes in the team data or setup data between rounds that could affect streak calculations. Ensure that team data is consistent throughout the simulation.Testing with Sample Data: If possible, create a small sample dataset with a few rounds and matches to test your code thoroughly. This can help you identify and fix any issues in a controlled environment.By carefully examining your code, validating the round files, and debugging the process, you should be able to pinpoint the issue and resolve the streak calculation problem when simulating all matches. If you encounter specific errors or issues during the debugging process, feel free to share those, and I can provide more targeted assistance.
