ChatGPTThank you for providing your code. It seems that the code you've shared has the logic for reading CSV files, processing matches, and updating team statistics. However, there's a small issue in your code that's causing the wins, draws, and losses not to be updated correctly. The issue is in the FootballCsvReader class when parsing the streak values from the CSV file.In your code, you're parsing the streak value as a single integer, which doesn't account for the wins, draws, and losses separately. Here's the relevant part of your code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]To fix this issue, you need to update your code to correctly update the wins, draws, and losses based on the streak values in the CSV file. You can do this by checking the streakResult character for 'W', 'D', or 'L' and updating the corresponding property of the CurrentStreak object. Here's an updated code snippet:[CODE_BLOCK_1]With this change, your code should correctly update the wins, draws, and losses for each team, and your league standings should display the correct values.
