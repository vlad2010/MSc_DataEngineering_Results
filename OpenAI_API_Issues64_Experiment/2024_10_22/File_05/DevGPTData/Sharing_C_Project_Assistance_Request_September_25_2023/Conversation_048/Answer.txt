ChatGPTYes, you can generate random goal scores for your matches using Python. You can use the random module to generate random numbers for the goals scored by each team. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to generate random goal scores:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This code defines a generate_random_score() function that generates random scores for each match. The generated scores are in the format "home_goals-away_goals," with both home and away goals being random integers between 0 and 5. The rest of your code remains the same, but it now assigns these random scores to each match before writing the data to a CSV file.
