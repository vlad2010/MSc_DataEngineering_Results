ChatGPTIt appears that you have provided an example of a "round-1.csv" file with match result data. Each row represents a match with columns for the home team, away team, score, match date, and stadium. The format of your CSV file seems correct, and it contains six matches for this specific round.You mentioned having a total of 32 such files, each representing a different round of matches. To process these files in your application, you can do the following:Create a loop that iterates over the 32 round files, loading and processing them one by one.Inside the loop, for each round file, you can call the ProcessRoundResults method of your FootballProcessor class to update team statistics based on the match results.Here's a simplified example of how you can modify your existing code to process all the round files:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code snippet, it iterates from round 1 to round 32, constructing the file name for each round and checking if the file exists. If the file exists, it processes the round using the FootballProcessor.You can place this loop after loading setup and team data in your Main method to process all the rounds.
