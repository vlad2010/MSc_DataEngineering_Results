ChatGPTIt seems that the matches have been simulated correctly for the first 32 rounds, but there is an issue with the teams' total games played exceeding the limit of 22 games per team. To ensure that each team plays a maximum of 22 matches and only plays against the same team once they've played against everyone else, we may need to adjust the match schedules.Let's make the necessary adjustments to the match schedules. Here's the corrected schedule for the remaining rounds:Round 21:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Round 22:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Round 23:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Round 24:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Round 25:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Round 26:[CODE_BLOCK_5]Round 27:[CODE_BLOCK_6]Round 28:[CODE_BLOCK_7]Round 29:[CODE_BLOCK_8]Round 30:[CODE_BLOCK_9]Round 31:[CODE_BLOCK_10]Round 32:[CODE_BLOCK_11]With these adjustments, each team will have played a total of 22 matches, and they will only play against the same team once they've played against everyone else. Please update your match schedules with these changes, and it should work correctly. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
