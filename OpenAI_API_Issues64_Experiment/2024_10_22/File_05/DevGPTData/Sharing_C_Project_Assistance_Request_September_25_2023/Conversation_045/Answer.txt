ChatGPTI apologize for the confusion. It seems I made an error in my previous response. To resolve the error, you should define the processor variable before the while loop and then use it inside the case 4 block. Here's the corrected code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By defining processor outside the while loop, you ensure that it's available and retains its state throughout the loop iterations. This should resolve the error.
