ChatGPTIt looks like the issue is related to how the wins, draws, and losses are being counted and updated in the standings. Based on your provided output, it appears that the wins and losses for some teams are not being updated correctly.Without seeing the specific code that handles the calculation and update of wins, draws, and losses, it's a bit challenging to pinpoint the exact issue. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to troubleshoot and fix this issue:Check the Logic for Calculating Wins, Draws, and Losses: Review the part of your code that calculates the results of each match and updates the team standings. Ensure that the logic for determining the winner, loser, or a draw is correct. Double-check that the variables tracking wins, draws, and losses are updated accurately.Ensure Match Results Are Processed Correctly: Verify that the match results are being processed correctly when reading from the CSV files. Check that goals scored and conceded are assigned to the correct teams.Inspect the Streak Calculation: Review the code responsible for calculating streaks for each team. Ensure that the logic for tracking wins, draws, and losses in the streak is accurate and that it updates based on the match results.Debugging: Consider adding debugging statements or logging to track the intermediate values and calculations during the processing of matches and updating of standings. This can help you identify where the issue occurs.Test Cases: Create test cases with known match results and check if the standings are updated correctly. This can help isolate the problem.If you can provide specific code snippets related to the calculation of wins, draws, and losses, or any other relevant parts of your code, I can provide more specific guidance. Additionally, if you encounter any specific errors or unexpected behaviors during debugging, please let me know, and I can assist in addressing those issues.
