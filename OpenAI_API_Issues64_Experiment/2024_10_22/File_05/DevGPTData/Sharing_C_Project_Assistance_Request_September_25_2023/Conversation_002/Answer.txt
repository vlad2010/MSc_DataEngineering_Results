ChatGPTIt appears that you have a C# class named LeagueSetup that represents the setup for a sports league, and it has a constructor for initializing the league setup properties as well as a static method ParseSetupCsv for parsing setup data from a CSV file. This is a good start, but if you have specific questions or need further assistance with this class or any other part of your project, please let me know how I can help you.
