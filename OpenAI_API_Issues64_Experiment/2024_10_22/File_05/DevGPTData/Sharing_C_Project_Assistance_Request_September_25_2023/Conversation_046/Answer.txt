ChatGPTIt looks like the streaks are not being updated correctly. To address this issue, we need to ensure that the UpdateStreak and UpdateStreakForTeam methods are correctly tracking the streaks. The issue might be related to how the streaks are being reset in these methods.Here's a modification to the UpdateStreak and UpdateStreakForTeam methods to help you debug and potentially fix the issue:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By adding these Console.WriteLine statements, you can check the values of homeTeamWon, awayTeamWon, and isDraw for each match, as well as the updates to the streaks for each team. This should help you identify where the issue is occurring in the streak calculations.After making these modifications, run the simulation again and check the console output to see if the streaks are being updated correctly. If you encounter any unexpected behavior, please share the relevant output, and I can assist you further in diagnosing and resolving the issue.
