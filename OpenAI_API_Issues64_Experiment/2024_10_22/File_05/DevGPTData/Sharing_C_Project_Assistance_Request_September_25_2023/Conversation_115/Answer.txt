ChatGPTThank you for sharing your Program.cs code. It appears that you are loading data from CSV files and simulating football matches correctly. To address the issue where Viborg FF (VB) has played fewer matches than expected, it's important to ensure that your data is correctly read from the CSV files and processed during the simulation.Here are some steps to investigate and potentially resolve the issue:Check CSV Data: Double-check your CSV files, especially the round-*.csv files, to ensure that they contain the correct match data for all rounds, including matches involving Viborg FF. Verify that there are no missing matches or data for Viborg FF.Check Simulation Logic: Review the logic in the FootballProcessor class, particularly the methods responsible for reading and processing match data. Ensure that it correctly counts the number of matches played by each team, including Viborg FF.Debugging: Use debugging techniques to inspect the data at various stages of your code execution. Verify that the data read from CSV files is correctly parsed and stored.Logging: Consider adding logging statements to your code to track the progress and identify any issues. Log relevant information during the reading and processing of match data.Update Logic: If you identify any issues with your data or logic, update your code accordingly to ensure that Viborg FF plays the correct number of matches.Error Handling: Implement error handling and validation to catch any potential issues when reading and processing CSV files.Data Consistency: Ensure that the team abbreviation for Viborg FF (VB) is consistent throughout your code, including the CSV files and team data.By carefully reviewing your code and data, you should be able to identify and address the issue causing Viborg FF to have an incorrect number of played matches in the standings.
