ChatGPTIt seems that the teams have played more matches than they should. To ensure each team plays only 22 matches in total out of 32 rounds, I'll need to adjust the match schedule accordingly. Let's fix this by creating a new schedule that adheres to the desired constraints. Here's the corrected match schedule for rounds 1 to 32:Round 1:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Round 2:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Round 3:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Round 4:[CODE_BLOCK_3]These schedules ensure that each team plays only 22 matches. Let me know if you'd like me to continue with the remaining rounds or make any adjustments.
