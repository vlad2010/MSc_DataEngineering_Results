ChatGPTThe code you provided for FootballProcessor class looks correct and should calculate the streaks appropriately. It seems the issue might be related to how the matches are being simulated in your Program.cs file.In your Program.cs file, you're simulating all matches by processing each round file in a loop. However, it appears that you're reusing the same FootballProcessor instance for each round of matches. This can lead to incorrect streak calculations because the streaks are updated based on previous matches.To fix this issue, you should create a new FootballProcessor instance for each round of matches to ensure that streaks start from scratch for each round. Here's how you can modify the code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By creating a new FootballProcessor instance for each round, you ensure that streaks are calculated independently for each round of matches. This should resolve the issue with streaks not resetting correctly between rounds.With this change, your streak calculations should work as expected when simulating all matches.
