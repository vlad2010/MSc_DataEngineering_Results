ChatGPTNo, you don't need to change the CSV file manually. The C# code provided in the previous response generates random scores for the matches and updates the CSV data with these random scores. You can use the existing CSV file you provided without any modifications.When you run the C# code, it will generate random scores for each match and overwrite the existing CSV file with the updated data, including the random scores. You just need to make sure the CSV file exists in the same directory as the C# code, and the code will take care of updating it with the random scores for each match.
