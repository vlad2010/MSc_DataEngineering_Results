This is how my csv files are formatted HomeTeam,AwayTeam,Score,MatchDate,Stadium
FCK,BIF,1-1,2025-08-01,Stadium 1
FCM,AGF,2-3,2025-08-01,Stadium 2
OB,VIB,0-0,2025-08-01,Stadium 3
SIF,RFC,2-3,2025-08-01,Stadium 4
VB,HIF,0-1,2025-08-01,Stadium 5
FCN,LBF,2-2,2025-08-01,Stadium 6
 Can you make the format like that?
