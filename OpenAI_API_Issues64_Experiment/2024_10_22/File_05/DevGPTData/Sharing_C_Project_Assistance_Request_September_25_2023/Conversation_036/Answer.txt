ChatGPTI apologize for the misunderstanding. If the issue is related to the streak not working as expected when you simulate all matches, it could be due to how the streak is updated in your FootballProcessor class during the simulation.Here's what you can do to ensure that the streak is correctly updated when simulating all matches:Check the ProcessRoundResults method in your FootballProcessor class and ensure that it properly updates the streak for each team based on the match results in the round file. Make sure that you are correctly incrementing the wins, draws, and losses in the streak for each team.When simulating all matches, you should process each round file one by one in the correct order, and after processing all matches in a round, check the league standings to ensure that the streak has been updated correctly.If you notice that the streak is not being updated as expected, you may need to debug the ProcessRoundResults method to identify any issues in how the streak is being calculated and updated.Without seeing the specific code for your FootballProcessor class and how the streak is managed in the ProcessRoundResults method, it's challenging to provide a more specific solution. If you can provide more details or specific code snippets related to this issue, I'd be happy to assist further in identifying and resolving the problem.
