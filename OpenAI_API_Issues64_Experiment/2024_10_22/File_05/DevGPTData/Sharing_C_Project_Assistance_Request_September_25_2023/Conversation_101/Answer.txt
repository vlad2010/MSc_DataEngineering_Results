ChatGPTI apologize for the oversight. I understand your requirement now. You need a schedule where each team plays a maximum of 22 games, playing against each other twice, and ensuring they play against all other teams before facing the same team again. Here's the revised schedule in 32 CSV files to meet these criteria:Round 23:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Round 24:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Round 25:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Round 26:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Round 27:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Round 28:[CODE_BLOCK_5]Round 29:[CODE_BLOCK_6]Round 30:[CODE_BLOCK_7]Round 31:[CODE_BLOCK_8]Round 32:[CODE_BLOCK_9]
