It doesnt look right. Listing closely. A team is only allowed to play against each other two times. Thats why there is 32 csv files. So can you make them expand a bit and ONLY play 22 games in total. Two times against each other. And if they played against a team, they have to play against everyone else before they can play against the same team. So can you make a schecule from 1 csv file to 32 that does that?
