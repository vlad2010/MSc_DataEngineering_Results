ChatGPTI apologize for the confusion. It seems that the LeagueSetup class does not have a property called Rounds. In this case, you should specify the number of rounds directly in your code. If you want to generate 32 rounds, you can modify the code like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Replace the following lines in your code with the specified lines above. This way, you'll directly specify the number of rounds without relying on a property in LeagueSetup.
