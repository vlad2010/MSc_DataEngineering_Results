ChatGPTThank you for providing your code. The issue you are facing, where the statistics are resetting after processing each round, is happening because you are working with a new instance of the FootballProcessor class for each round. Each time you create a new FootballProcessor object, it initializes a new list of teams with their statistics reset.To fix this issue and maintain the accumulated statistics across multiple rounds, you should keep the same instance of FootballProcessor throughout the program's execution. Here's how you can modify your Program.cs to achieve this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By creating a single instance of FootballProcessor (processor) at the beginning of your program and using it throughout, the statistics will be accumulated across multiple rounds instead of resetting after each round.
