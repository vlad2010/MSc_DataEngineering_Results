ChatGPTCertainly, I can provide you with a sample CSV file in the format you specified. Here's an example of a CSV file named "round-01.csv":[CODE_BLOCK_0]You can save this content to a text file with a ".csv" extension, and it will be in the format you requested for one round of matches. To create multiple rounds, you can use the code provided earlier to generate the schedule for the entire season and save each round to separate CSV files.
