ChatGPTThe issue with the streaks not persisting and draws counting as 2 instead of 1 is likely related to how you're processing each round of matches without considering the previous match results. To ensure that streaks persist and draws are counted correctly across multiple rounds, you need to update your logic to take into account the team's historical performance.Here's a general outline of how you can modify your code to address these issues:Modify the Team class:You should modify the Team class to store historical streak information. For example, you can add a List<Team.Streak> property to keep track of streaks for each round. Each time you process a match, you update the streak for the respective team based on the match result.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Update streaks when processing matches:When processing a match, you should update the team's streaks based on the match result and the team's historical performance. Here's an example of how to do it:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Update the FootballProcessor class:In the FootballProcessor class, when processing matches, make sure to update the streaks for each team.[CODE_BLOCK_2]With these modifications, each team will have a list of streaks, one for each round of matches. When processing a match, you update the streak for the current round based on the match result. This way, streaks will persist across rounds, and draws will be correctly counted as 1 point.
