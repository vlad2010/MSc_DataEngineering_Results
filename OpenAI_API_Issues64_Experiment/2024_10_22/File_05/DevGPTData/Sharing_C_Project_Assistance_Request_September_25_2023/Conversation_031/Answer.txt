ChatGPTI see that the issue still persists. The problem might be due to how the round files are named or how they are being read from the directory. To ensure that the round files are processed in the correct order, you can modify the file naming convention to include leading zeros for rounds less than 10 (e.g., "round-01.csv" instead of "round-1.csv"). This way, the files will be sorted correctly.Here's how you can modify the code:Rename your round files to include leading zeros, such as "round-01.csv," "round-02.csv," etc., up to "round-32.csv."Modify the code to sort the round files by their names as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By including leading zeros in the file names, you ensure that they are sorted correctly and processed in the expected order (e.g., "round-01.csv" will come before "round-02.csv"). This should resolve the issue with the order of processing and streak calculation.
