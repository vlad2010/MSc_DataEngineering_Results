ChatGPTIt looks like the issue is occurring when you run the "Simulate all matches" option multiple times. This is likely because you are processing the same round file (round-02.csv) repeatedly, which leads to duplicate results being added to the teams' statistics.To fix this issue, you should keep track of which round files have already been processed and skip them in subsequent simulations. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:Add a HashSet<string> to keep track of processed round files.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Before processing a round file, check if it has already been processed. If it has, skip it; otherwise, process it and add it to the set of processed files.[CODE_BLOCK_1]With these changes, your code will only process each round file once, even if you choose to simulate all matches multiple times. This should prevent the issue of duplicate results in the league standings.
