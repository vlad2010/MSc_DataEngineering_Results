ChatGPTThank you for providing your updated Program.cs code. It looks like you've added the option to simulate all matches, which is a great addition. Regarding the issue of streaks resetting when you load a new match, it's important to ensure that the Team objects and their streaks are preserved between different rounds of matches.To address this issue, you should make sure that the Team objects used by the FootballProcessor are not recreated or reinitialized when you load a new match. Here are the steps to achieve this:Modify the FootballProcessor constructor to store a copy of the original Team objects and work with that copy throughout the processing. This way, you won't modify the original Team objects.[CODE_BLOCK_0]When processing a new round of matches, reset the statistics (such as goals, points, and streaks) of the working copy of Team objects but keep the original Team objects unchanged. This can be done by calling a method to reset the statistics on each Team object in the working copy.[CODE_BLOCK_1]Before processing each round, call the ResetTeamStatistics method to reset the statistics of the working copy of Team objects while keeping the original Team objects unchanged.[CODE_BLOCK_2]With these changes, your FootballProcessor will preserve the original Team objects and their streaks between different rounds of matches while resetting the statistics for each new round. This should resolve the issue of streaks resetting when you load a new match.
