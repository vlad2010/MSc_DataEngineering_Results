ChatGPTApologies for the oversight. The error occurs because the signature of the curl_debug_callback function does not match the required prototype for libcurl's debug callback. To resolve this issue, we need to change the return type and parameters of the curl_debug_callback function to match the expected prototype.Here's the correct version of the curl_debug_callback function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this updated curl_debug_callback function, we handle various types of debug information and print them accordingly.To resolve the "redeclared as different kind of entity" error, make sure to remove any previous declaration of curl_debug_callback in your code before adding the correct version above.With these changes, please try running the program again, and you should see the debug information, including the email body chunks, printed to the console output. If you encounter any further issues or have more questions, feel free to let me know, and I'll be glad to assist you further.
