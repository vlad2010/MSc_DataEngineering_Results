ChatGPTSure! Here's an intermediate-level coding exercise for C programming:Exercise: Array IntersectionWrite a C program that takes two integer arrays as input and finds the intersection of the two arrays. The intersection of two arrays is a new array that contains only the common elements between the two arrays, without any duplicates.Your program should implement the following function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The function takes the following parameters:arr1: an integer array containing the elements of the first array.size1: an integer representing the size of the first array.arr2: an integer array containing the elements of the second array.size2: an integer representing the size of the second array.intersection: an integer array to store the resulting intersection elements.size3: a pointer to an integer that will store the size of the resulting intersection array.Your program should find the intersection of arr1 and arr2 and store the common elements in the intersection array. The resulting intersection array should not contain any duplicates, and its size should be stored in the size3 variable.You can assume that the input arrays are sorted in ascending order and that the intersection array has enough space to accommodate the result.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Output:[CODE_BLOCK_2]In the provided example, the arrays arr1 and arr2 have common elements 3, 4, and 5. The resulting intersection array contains these elements, and the size of the intersection array is stored in the size3 variable.
