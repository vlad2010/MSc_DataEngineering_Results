ChatGPTIn C++, there is no predefined macro equivalent to __FILE__ and __LINE__ specifically for capturing the current function name. However, you can use a combination of the __func__ identifier and the __LINE__ macro to achieve a similar effect.Here's an updated version of the Logger class that includes the function name in the log output:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated code, I have added a new parameter const char* function to the log() function. This parameter allows you to pass the __func__ identifier, which represents the current function name.Here's an example of how you can use the updated Logger class to include the function name in the log output:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In this example, the __func__ identifier is passed as the function parameter to the log() function, allowing the logger to include the current function name in the log output.
