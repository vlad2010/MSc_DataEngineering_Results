ChatGPTThe output of the example code will depend on the contents of the "log.txt" file after running the program. However, I can provide an example of how the output might look based on the given log level and log messages.Assuming the log level is set to DEBUG and the "log.txt" file is initially empty, the output in the "log.txt" file after running the program would be:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note that <timestamp> will be replaced with the actual timestamp when the log messages are written.Each log message includes the timestamp, file, line number, log level, and the corresponding log message. Since the log level is set to DEBUG, all the log messages in the example will be written to the log file.Please keep in mind that __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros will be replaced with the actual file name and line number where the log function is called.
