ChatGPTCertainly! You can use a #define directive to simplify the usage of the logging facility. Here's an example of how you can define a macro to simplify logging:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this macro, you can log messages using the LOG macro, providing the logger instance, the log message, and the desired log level.Here's an updated example of how you can use the logging facility with the defined macro:[CODE_BLOCK_1]The LOG macro expands to logger.log(message, __FILE__, __LINE__, level), which simplifies the logging syntax and avoids the need to explicitly provide __FILE__ and __LINE__ at each log call.Using the macro improves the readability and reduces the amount of code needed to log messages with the desired log level.
