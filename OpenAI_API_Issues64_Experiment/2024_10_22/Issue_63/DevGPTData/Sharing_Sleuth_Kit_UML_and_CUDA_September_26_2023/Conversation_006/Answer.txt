ChatGPTFinished workingShow workIt seems there is still an issue locating the file binsrch_index.cpp at the specified path. However, since you uploaded the Sleuth Kit source code again, I'll extract it and attempt to read the file directly from the newly provided source.Finished workingShow workIt appears the extraction was successful, but we are still unable to locate the binsrch_index.cpp file at the specified path. It seems the file might not be present in the provided source code, or there may be a difference in the directory structure or file location.Since the direct approach to read the file seems to be facing challenges, you might consider navigating through the extracted source code on your local machine or development environment to locate the binsrch_index.cpp file and then possibly share the specific contents of that file or the correct relative path here.Would you like to proceed this way, or is there another specific file or part of the source code you would like to explore or discuss in the meantime?
