ChatGPTYou're correct; by default, dnsmasq and most DNS servers use port 53. You can change the port dnsmasq listens on by adding the --port flag, like you mentioned.For example, to start dnsmasq on port 1234, you can run:[CODE_BLOCK_0]To query this custom port with dig, you can specify the port using the -p option. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will send a DNS query to localhost on port 1234, querying for the address of google.com.Note that running a DNS server on a non-standard port is useful for testing but is not generally recommended for production use because DNS clients will typically expect to find a DNS server on port 53.
