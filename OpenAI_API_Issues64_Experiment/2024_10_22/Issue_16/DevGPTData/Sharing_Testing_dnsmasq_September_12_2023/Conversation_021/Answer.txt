ChatGPTActually, the ip link add command in the original example creates a pair of connected virtual Ethernet interfaces (veth) in a single command. The two interfaces are created together and are automatically connected back-to-back. You can't simply split the original command into two separate ip link add commands because you would lose that automatic pairing.Here is the original command for reference:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This command creates veth1 and its peer veth2 together, ensuring they are connected. This is essential for virtual networking, as it creates a virtual "wire" between the two endpoints.If you were to create veth1 and veth2 separately, there would be no automatic way to connect them back-to-back, and they would not function as a veth pair. So, unfortunately, that single command can't be split in the way you're suggesting while preserving its original intent.
