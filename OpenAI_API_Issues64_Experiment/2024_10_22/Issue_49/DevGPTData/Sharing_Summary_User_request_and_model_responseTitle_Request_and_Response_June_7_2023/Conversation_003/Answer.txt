ChatGPTCertainly! I've modified the log() function to include the file and line information using the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros. Here's the updated code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Now, the log() function takes two additional parameters: const char* file and int line. These parameters will be automatically filled in by the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros when calling the log() function.Here's an example of how you can use the updated Logger class:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Now, each log message will include the file and line where the log message was thrown.
