ChatGPTCertainly! I have modified the Logger class to support sending the log output to either a file or the standard output (std::cout) based on whether a filename is provided in the constructor. Here's the updated code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated code, the Logger class constructor is modified to accept an optional filename parameter with a default value of an empty string. If a non-empty filename is provided, the log file is opened and the log messages are directed to the file. If no filename is provided (or an empty string is given), the log messages are sent to the standard output (std::cout).Here's an example of how you can use the updated Logger class without providing a filename:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In this example, since no filename is provided, the log messages will be sent to the standard output (std::cout).
