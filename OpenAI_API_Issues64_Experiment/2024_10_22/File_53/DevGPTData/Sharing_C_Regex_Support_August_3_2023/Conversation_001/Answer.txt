ChatGPTTo support regex in the query, you can use the <regex> header in C++. Here's the modified version of the queryFile function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this change, you can now use regular expressions in your query. For example, if you want to search for the word "hello" or "world", you can use the query string "(hello|world)". Please note that regular expressions can be more complex, and you can customize the query according to your requirements. Also, don't forget to escape any regex special characters in the query string if you want to search for them literally.
