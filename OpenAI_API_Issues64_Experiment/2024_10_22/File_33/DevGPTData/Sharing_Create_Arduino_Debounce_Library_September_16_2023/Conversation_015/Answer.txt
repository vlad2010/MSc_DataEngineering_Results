ChatGPTUnderstood. I'll implement the update(bool bit) function to update the button states based on digitalRead() if _pin is valid:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function:If _pin is valid (greater than or equal to 0), it updates _lastButtonState with the current _buttonState value and then updates _buttonState based on the result of digitalRead(_pin) compared with _polarity.If _pin is not valid, it still updates _lastButtonState with the current _buttonState value but sets _buttonState based on the provided bit.
