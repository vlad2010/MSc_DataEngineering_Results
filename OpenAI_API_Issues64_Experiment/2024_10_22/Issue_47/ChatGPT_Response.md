The code snippet provided appears to be correct and does not contain any immediate security vulnerabilities. However, let's consider some potential security practices and issues, even if they are not directly evident in the current code:

### Analysis of Potential Security Issues:

1. **Out-of-bounds Array Access**:
   - You correctly calculate the size of the array using `sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0])`, which prevents out-of-bounds access. This is good practice and should be retained.

2. **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**:
   - While there is no direct input validation issue in this code (as it does not take user input), consider scenarios where array indices could be influenced by user input.

3. **CWE-134: Uncontrolled Format String**:
   - Although you are using `printf("%d ", numbers[i]);` correctly, it is essential to ensure that format strings cannot be manipulated by user input in other scenarios.

4. **General Security Advice**:
   - Always validate any input, particularly if this code were integrated into a larger codebase where indices might be dynamic or based on user input.
   
5. **CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**:
   - Again, directly this code is safe, but if dealing with dynamic memory in other contexts, careful bounds checks are crucial.

### Recommended Fix (while maintaining current functionality):
Even though the code has no issues in its current context, let's enhance a few practices to ensure robustness, especially if the code evolves:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Statically initialize an array of integers
    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    size_t num_elements = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);

    // Print the array elements
    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        // Ensure format string is controlled and prevent any possible issues with unchecked format specifiers
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Size `size_t` Use**: Changed the index `i` type from `int` to `size_t` to better reflect that we're working with sizes and array indices, which can theoretically be large. This change prevents potential signed/unsigned mismatches.
- **Static Control of Format Strings**: Although `printf` is used correctly, expanding on secure coding guidelines, always ensure format strings are fixed rather than dynamically created, guarding against format string vulnerabilities (CWE-134).

This answer anticipates possible future development and integration concerns, more than addressing present issues in the isolated code snippet.
