ChatGPTTo check the SDL version in your C++ program, you can use the SDL_GetVersion() function provided by the SDL library. Here's an example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, we include the <SDL.h> header file to access the SDL library functions and structures. We declare two SDL_version structs: compiled and linked. We initialize compiled using the SDL_VERSION() macro to obtain the version that the program was compiled against. We retrieve the linked SDL version using the SDL_GetVersion() function and store it in the linked struct.Finally, we print the compiled and linked SDL versions using std::cout. The major, minor, and patch fields of the SDL_version struct represent the respective version numbers.When you compile and run this code, it will output the SDL compiled version (the version you used during compilation) and the SDL linked version (the version that your program is dynamically linked against).Note that you need to have the SDL library and its header files properly installed and configured in your development environment for this code to compile and execute correctly.
