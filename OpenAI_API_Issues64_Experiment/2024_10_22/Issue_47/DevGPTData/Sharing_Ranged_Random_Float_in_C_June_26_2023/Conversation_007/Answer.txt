ChatGPTThe SDL_IntersectRectF function is part of the SDL 2.0.12 library or later. It is a function for intersecting two rectangles in the SDL library, where the rectangles are defined using floating-point coordinates (SDL_RectF).If you are using an older version of the SDL library, such as SDL 2.0.11 or earlier, the SDL_IntersectRectF function may not be available. In that case, you can consider upgrading your SDL library to a version that supports the SDL_IntersectRectF function.It's worth noting that the availability of specific functions can also depend on the platform and the specific build options used when compiling the SDL library. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consult the SDL documentation or the release notes for the specific version you are using to confirm the availability of the SDL_IntersectRectF function.
