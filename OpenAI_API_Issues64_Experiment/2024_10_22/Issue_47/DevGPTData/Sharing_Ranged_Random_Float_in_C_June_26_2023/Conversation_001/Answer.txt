ChatGPTCertainly! Here's an example of a function in C++ that generates a random float within a specified range:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, the getRandomFloat function takes two parameters: min and max, which define the range of the random float. The function uses the <random> library in C++ to generate random numbers. It first creates a random seed using std::random_device, then seeds the random number generator std::mt19937 with the obtained seed. Finally, it creates a uniform real distribution std::uniform_real_distribution<float> with the specified range and generates a random float using the distribution and the generator.The example main function demonstrates the usage of the getRandomFloat function by generating a random float between 1.0 and 10.0 and printing the result.Note that the std::random_device may not be available on all systems or may not provide a truly random seed. In such cases, you can consider using an alternative method for obtaining a random seed, such as using the current time.
