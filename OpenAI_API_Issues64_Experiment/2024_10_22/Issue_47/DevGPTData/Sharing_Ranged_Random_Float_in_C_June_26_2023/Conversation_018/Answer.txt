ChatGPTNo, you don't necessarily need a different collisionNormal for each direction of collision. The collision normal represents the direction perpendicular to the collision surface, regardless of the direction of collision.In many cases, the collision normal can be determined based on the geometry or shape of the objects involved in the collision. For example, if you have rectangular objects, the collision normal will be either along the x-axis or the y-axis, depending on the orientation of the collision.Here's an updated example that demonstrates how you can calculate the collision normal based on the direction of collision:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated example, we introduce a CalculateCollisionNormal() function that takes a collisionDirection vector as a parameter. The collisionDirection vector represents the direction of the collision. In this case, we assume collision from left to right along the x-axis.The CalculateCollisionNormal() function calculates the collision normal by taking the negative of the collisionDirection vector's y-component and the positive of its x-component. This gives us a vector perpendicular to the collision surface.We then use this calculated collisionNormal to reflect the velocities of the objects, just like in the previous example.By calculating the collision normal based on the collision direction, you can handle collisions from different directions using a single collisionNormal vector. However, the specific calculations and formulas for the collision normal may vary depending on the geometry or shape of the objects and the specific collision scenario you are dealing with.
