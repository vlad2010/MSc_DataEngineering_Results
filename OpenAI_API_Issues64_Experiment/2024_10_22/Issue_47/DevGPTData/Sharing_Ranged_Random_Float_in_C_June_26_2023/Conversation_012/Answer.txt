ChatGPTThe error message "undefined symbol" typically indicates that there is a linking issue between object files or libraries during the execution phase. While your code compiles successfully, it fails to resolve certain symbols at runtime.Here are a few possible reasons for this error and some steps you can take to resolve it:Missing library: Ensure that you have linked the necessary libraries correctly. In Code::Blocks, you can go to Project → Build Options → Linker Settings and add the required libraries in the "Link libraries" section.Incorrect library order: If you are linking multiple libraries, the order in which they are listed can matter. If library B depends on symbols from library A, make sure that library A is listed before library B in the linker settings.Compiler flags: Check if you are missing any necessary compiler flags or options. For example, certain libraries may require specific compiler flags to enable certain features.Outdated library: If you are using a library that has undergone updates or changes, make sure you are using the correct version of the library that matches your code. An outdated library might lack the symbol you are trying to reference.Linker paths: Verify that the linker can find the required libraries by adding the appropriate library paths in the linker settings. This is necessary when using libraries installed in non-standard locations.Misspelled symbol name: Check if you have mistyped the symbol name or made any typos. Ensure that the symbol you are referencing matches the one defined in the library.Double-checking these aspects should help you identify and resolve the "undefined symbol" error in Code::Blocks. If the issue persists, please provide more details about your code, the libraries you are using, and the exact error message you are encountering.
