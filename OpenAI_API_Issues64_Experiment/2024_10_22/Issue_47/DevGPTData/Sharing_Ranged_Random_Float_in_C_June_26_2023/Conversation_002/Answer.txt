ChatGPTCertainly! Here's an example of a function in C++ that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D space:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, we define a Point struct with x and y coordinates. The calculateDistance function takes two Point objects (p1 and p2) as input and calculates the Euclidean distance between them using the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). The function returns the calculated distance as a float.The example main function demonstrates the usage of the calculateDistance function by creating two Point objects and calculating the distance between them. The result is then printed to the console.Please note that in this example, the code assumes a 2D space. If you need to calculate the distance in a different number of dimensions, you can extend the Point struct and modify the calculation accordingly.
