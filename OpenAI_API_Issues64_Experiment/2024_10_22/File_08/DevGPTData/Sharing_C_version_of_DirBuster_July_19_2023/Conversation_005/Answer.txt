ChatGPTApologies for the inconvenience. Here's the remaining part of the program:[CODE_BLOCK_0]To compile the program, run:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Usage:[CODE_BLOCK_2]This version of the program creates 10 threads (NUM_THREADS) to perform the scanning concurrently, which makes it more aggressive. You can adjust the number of threads by modifying the NUM_THREADS constant. However, be cautious when increasing the number of threads, as it might lead to excessive resource usage or potentially triggering security mechanisms on the target web server.
