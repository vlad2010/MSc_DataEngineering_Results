ChatGPTScanning a web server running on a TV may require a more specific wordlist, as TVs usually have a custom web interface with different directory structures and filenames compared to typical web servers. However, you can start with a smaller, more common wordlist and work your way up to larger ones as needed.A good starting point would be using the common.txt wordlist in the SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content directory. It contains a list of common directories and filenames that might exist on a variety of web servers, including those running on TVs.[CODE_BLOCK_0]If you don't get the desired results with the common.txt wordlist, you can try other wordlists like raft-small-directories.txt, raft-small-files.txt, or even larger ones like raft-large-directories.txt and raft-large-files.txt.Please keep in mind that scanning devices without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Always obtain permission before performing any security testing on devices that you do not own.
