I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question.
You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way how to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications.
Please write code where detected secutiry issue is fixed, please write all code in one fragment. 

(```c
char buffer[1024];
int bytesReceived = recv(socket_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);

if (bytesReceived > 0) {
    // 데이터가 도착함, buffer에 있는 데이터를 처리
} else if (bytesReceived == 0) {
    // 연결이 종료됨
} else {
    // 오류가 발생했거나 연결이 중단됨
}

```)
