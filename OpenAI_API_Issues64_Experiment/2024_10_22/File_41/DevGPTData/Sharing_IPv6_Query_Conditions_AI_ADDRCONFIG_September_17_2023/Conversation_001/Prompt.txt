If the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag is specified then a query for IPv6 address records should occur only if the node has at least one IPv6 source address configured. A query for IPv4 address records will always occur, whether or not any IPv4 addresses are configured. The loopback address is not considered for this case as valid as a configured sources address.
