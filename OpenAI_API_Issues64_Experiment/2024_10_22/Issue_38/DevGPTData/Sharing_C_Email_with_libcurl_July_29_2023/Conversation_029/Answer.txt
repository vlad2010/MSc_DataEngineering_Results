ChatGPTCertainly! Let's analyze the changes made to the code and understand why it works now but didn't work before.Use of Global Variable for Payload:
In the initial code, the email content was stored in a local variable const std::string email_data. This variable's memory is managed on the stack and is deallocated when it goes out of scope (after the main function ends). However, libcurl needs access to this data even after the function ends, as it may continue to use it to send the email body in subsequent requests. Therefore, using a global static variable static const char *payload_text ensures that the email content remains accessible during the libcurl request.Avoiding Pointer Arithmetic in Payload Callback:
The initial code had a potential issue in the read_data_callback function with pointer arithmetic. It relied on the email_data->bytes_read variable to determine the start position of the payload data. In certain scenarios, such as when payload_data is not a null-terminated string, this could lead to undefined behavior. In the modified code, the use of the payload_text static variable avoids this issue.Explicitly Set CURLOPT_UPLOAD:
In the initial code, the CURLOPT_UPLOAD option was not explicitly set. Without this option being set, libcurl would interpret the request as an HTTP POST with a Content-Type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and it would not use the custom payload provided by the callback function. In the modified code, setting curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L) explicitly tells libcurl to use the data provided by the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback as the request body.Proper Debug Callback Function:
In the initial code, the debug callback function curl_debug_callback had a mismatch in its signature compared to what libcurl expected. In the modified code, the debug_callback function matches the correct signature, allowing libcurl to call it and print the debug information correctly.By addressing these points and making the appropriate changes, the modified code ensures that the email content is properly sent in the request body, and the debug information is printed correctly. As a result, the program now works as expected and sends the email successfully using libcurl.Remember that using global variables should be done with caution, and it's generally better to pass the necessary data to the callback function through the userptr parameter as shown in the initial code. However, since libcurl expects CURLOPT_READFUNCTION to receive a pointer to data that persists during the request, the use of the global static variable is a valid approach in this specific case.I hope this analysis helps clarify the changes made and why the modified code works as intended.
