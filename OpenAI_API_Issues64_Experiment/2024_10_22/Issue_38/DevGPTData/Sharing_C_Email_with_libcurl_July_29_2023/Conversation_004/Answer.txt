ChatGPTI apologize for the inconvenience. If the code is still freezing, it's possible that there might be an issue with SSL setup or a problem specific to your environment. Here are a few more things to check and try:Verify libcurl Installation: Make sure that you have installed libcurl correctly and linked it properly in your C++ project. If you are using a package manager to install libcurl, ensure that you have the development headers and libraries installed as well.SSL Libraries: Check if you have the necessary SSL libraries installed on your system. libcurl requires SSL/TLS libraries to perform secure connections. For example, on Linux, you may need to have libssl-dev and libcurl4-openssl-dev packages installed.Check Error Messages: You can try to add more error handling to see if any specific error messages are being generated by libcurl. Modify the code to print more information:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By enabling verbose output, you might get more information about the SSL handshake and certificate verification.Try a Different SSL Version: If you have the option to do so, you can try using a different SSL version by setting the CURLOPT_SSLVERSION option. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Test a Different SMTP Server: If the issue persists, try using a different SMTP server to see if the problem is specific to Gmail's SMTP server.If none of these steps help resolve the issue, it's possible that there might be other environmental factors causing the problem. At this point, you might want to consider seeking help from a more specific support channel, such as a developer forum or contacting the libcurl community for assistance.
