ChatGPTCertainly! Here's an example of how to use CURLOPT_READFUNCTION and CURLOPT_READDATA with libcurl to send a custom message in the request body:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, we define a structure EmailData to hold the email content, and we implement the read_data_callback function to read data from this structure and send it as the request body. The CURLOPT_READFUNCTION option is set to the callback function, and the CURLOPT_READDATA option is set to the address of the EmailData structure.Please note that this example sends a custom message in the request body to httpbin.org/post, which is a test server that echoes back the request data. You should replace this URL with the endpoint where you want to send the email content.When you run the program, libcurl will use the read_data_callback function to read the email content from the EmailData structure and send it as the request body in the HTTP POST request.Make sure to have libcurl properly set up in your build environment, and you may need to link against the libcurl library during the compilation process. If you encounter any issues or have more questions, feel free to let me know, and I'll be glad to assist you further.
