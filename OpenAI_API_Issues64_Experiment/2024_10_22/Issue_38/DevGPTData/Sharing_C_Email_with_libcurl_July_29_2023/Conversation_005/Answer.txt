ChatGPTIf the curl command works correctly on the command line, but the C++ program using libcurl still freezes, there might be an issue specific to how libcurl is being used in the C++ environment.In that case, let's try a slightly different approach. We'll use a more modern and simpler library called "cpp-httplib" to send an email using Gmail's SMTP server. This library is header-only and easy to use. You won't need to deal with linking or additional installations.First, make sure you have cpp-httplib installed. If you haven't already, you can download it from the official GitHub repository: https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplibHere's the C++ code using cpp-httplib to send the email:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Make sure you have included the appropriate include path for cpp-httplib, and you may need to specify the SSL library when compiling (e.g., -lssl -lcrypto for OpenSSL). Refer to the library documentation for any additional configuration.This code uses cpp-httplib to create an HTTPS client, sets up SSL options, and then sends the email using Gmail's SMTP server. It should work more reliably than the previous libcurl-based implementation.Remember to have your secret file with the Gmail password in the same folder as the C++ program before running it.
