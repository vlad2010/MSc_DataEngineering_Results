ChatGPTSorry for any confusion. Yes, you can have separate sockets bound to different IP addresses on the same port number. For example, one socket can be bound to 192.0.2.1:12345 and another socket can be bound to 198.51.100.1:12345. In Python, that would look something like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, sock1 and sock2 are separate socket objects, each bound to a different IP address, but on the same port number. This allows you to separately handle the UDP traffic coming in on the different IP addresses.
