ChatGPTA packet gets duplicated and sent to all relevant sockets in a few specific scenarios:UDP Multicast and Broadcast: In UDP, if multiple sockets on the same host join the same multicast group or are listening for broadcasts, they will all receive a copy of each incoming multicast or broadcast packet. This essentially duplicates the packet at the application level.SO_REUSEPORT: This is a socket option that, when set, allows multiple sockets on the same host to bind to the same IP address and port number. When a packet arrives, the kernel will duplicate it and send it to all sockets that have bound to that address and port.Note: The behaviour of SO_REUSEPORT can vary between operating systems and is not available on all platforms. For example, on Linux, SO_REUSEPORT allows balancing incoming connections (or packets for UDP) across the sockets, rather than duplicating the incoming data. It is best to check the documentation for the specific platform you are working on.Remember that even when packets are duplicated in this way, they are not duplicated at the network level - each client only receives one copy of the packet. The duplication happens at the application level, with each socket receiving its own copy of the packet data.If the sockets are using TCP, incoming packets will not be duplicated. TCP sockets are connection-oriented, meaning that each connection is associated with a specific pair of IP addresses and port numbers. Therefore, each incoming packet belongs to a particular connection and will be delivered to the socket that is handling that connection.
