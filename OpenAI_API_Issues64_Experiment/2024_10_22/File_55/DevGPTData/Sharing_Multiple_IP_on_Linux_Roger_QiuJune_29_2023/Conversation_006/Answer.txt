ChatGPTNo, a single socket can't be bound to two different IP addresses. A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number combination. When you bind a socket, you are effectively telling the operating system that this specific socket is associated with a specific IP address and port number.However, you can bind a socket to the special IP address 0.0.0.0 (for IPv4) or :: (for IPv6). This is known as the "wildcard" address, and it tells the operating system to listen on all available IP addresses. In this way, a single socket can receive traffic sent to any IP address on the machine, but the socket itself is not bound directly to multiple addresses.For example, if you want a UDP socket to listen on all IP addresses for a machine, you would do something like this in Python:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, sock is a single socket listening on port 12345 for all IP addresses associated with the machine. Any traffic sent to port 12345 on any of the machine's IP addresses will be received by this socket.
