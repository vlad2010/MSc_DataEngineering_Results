ChatGPTCertainly! The function currentDetected will be similar to isVoltageDetected, but it will read bits 0 to 3 (instead of just bit 7) and return a value of the HUSB238_CurrentSetting enum type. Here's how the function could look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits is used to read 4 bits starting from the 0th bit (bit index 0). The value is then cast to the HUSB238_CurrentSetting enum type and returned.Does this look good to you?
