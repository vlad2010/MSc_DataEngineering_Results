Sure, let's analyze the given C code for security issues and address them with fixes. Additionally, we'll map these issues to their respective Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers where applicable.

### Security Issues

1. **Unchecked Return Values**:
   - Functions like `recvfrom` and `sendto` do not have their return values checked. This might lead to undetected network errors or partial data transmission.
   - **CWE-252**: "Unchecked Return Value"

2. **Format String Vulnerability**:
   - The use of `printf("Client: %x\n", bigEndianData);` could lead to undefined behavior if any format string vulnerabilities are exploited. However, in this controlled scenario, it is safe as long as `bigEndianData` is always an integer.
   - This is not a direct vulnerability here but a cautionary note.

3. **Secure Input Handling**:
   - The `scanf` function does not specify a width limit. If a very large input is given, this can lead to buffer-related issues or denial of service.
   - **CWE-20**: "Improper Input Validation"
  
4. **Infinite Loop**:
   - There's no exit condition in the `while (1)` loop, which could lead to an unresponsive application in real scenarios.

5. **Lack of Comments**:
   - For a real-world scenario, add comments to describe the purpose and function of blocks of code.
  
6. **Security Logging**:
   - No logging of network errors or transactions which might be useful for security auditing.

Let's address these potential issues with a revised and fixed version of the code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

#define PORT 3001
#define BUFFER_SIZE sizeof(int)

int main() {
    int server_socket;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr, client_addr;
    socklen_t client_addr_size = sizeof(client_addr);
    uint32_t number;
    int flag, c;
    ssize_t bytes_received, bytes_sent;

    // Create socket
    if ((server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)) < 0) {
        perror("socket creation failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));
    memset(&client_addr, 0, sizeof(client_addr));

    // Configure server address
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

    // Bind the socket to the server address
    if (bind(server_socket, (const struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) < 0) {
        perror("bind failed");
        close(server_socket);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("Server started. Waiting for messages...\n");

    while (1) {
        // Receive number from client
        bytes_received = recvfrom(server_socket, &number, sizeof(uint32_t), 0, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &client_addr_size);
        if (bytes_received < 0) {
            perror("recvfrom failed");
            continue;  // Skip this loop iteration and try again
        }

        if (bytes_received != sizeof(uint32_t)) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Received incorrect data size\n");
            continue;  // Skip this loop iteration and try again
        }

        uint32_t bigEndianData = ntohl(number);
        printf("Client: %x\n", bigEndianData);

        // Reply to client
        do {
            flag = 0;
            printf("Server (You): ");
            if (scanf("%8x", &number) != 1) {
                printf("Please enter a valid number.\n");
                flag = 1;
                while ((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);
            } else {
                number = htonl(number);  // Convert to big-endian before sending
            }
        } while (flag);

        bytes_sent = sendto(server_socket, &number, sizeof(uint32_t), 0, (const struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, client_addr_size);
        if (bytes_sent < 0) {
            perror("sendto failed");
        }
    }

    close(server_socket);
    return 0;
}
```

### Fixed Issues

- **Return Value Checks**: Added checks for `recvfrom` and `sendto` return values to handle errors appropriately.
- **Input Handling**: Added width specifier `"%8x"` in `scanf` to limit input size.
- **Error Messages**: Added error logging on multiple occasions to track failures.
- **Improved Loop Handling**: Although the loop does not exit, having error handling allows for partial recovery and skipping erroneous iterations.

This is a basic server and these fixes improve its robustness to a certain extent. Depending on the context (production, secure environments), additional security measures might be needed, such as input sanitization, authentication, encryption, and more comprehensive error logging and handling.
