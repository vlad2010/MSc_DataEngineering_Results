ChatGPTGreat, getAttached() sounds like a function that would check if the HUSB238 device is properly attached and accessible via I2C. The use of Adafruit_BusIO and Adafruit_I2CRegister should make the implementation straightforward and consistent with other Adafruit libraries.Here's a skeleton implementation that outlines the steps to perform this action:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this skeleton:HUSB238_PD_STATUS0 would be replaced with the actual register address where the "attached" status can be read from. This could be one of the #defines you had earlier.0bXXXX would be replaced with the actual bitmask needed to check the "attached" status.Would you like to fill in these details based on the HUSB238's specifications?
