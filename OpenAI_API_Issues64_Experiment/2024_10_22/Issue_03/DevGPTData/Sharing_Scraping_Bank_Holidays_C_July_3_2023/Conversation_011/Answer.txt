ChatGPTThe version of C++ required for the program depends on the features used in the code. The provided code should work with C++11 or later versions.It's generally recommended to use a modern version of C++, such as C++14 or C++17, as they offer additional features and improvements over earlier versions.To compile the program with a specific version of C++, you can specify the language standard using the -std flag when compiling. For example, to compile with C++17, you can use the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This command tells the compiler to use the C++17 language standard.If you are using an older version of the compiler or the C++ standard library, you may need to adjust the code to be compatible with that specific version. However, the provided code should work fine with most modern C++ compilers and standard library implementations.
