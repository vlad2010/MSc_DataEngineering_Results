ChatGPTThank you for sharing the final, working version of the code. It looks good and should be able to scrape the bank holidays for the given country and year from the specified website.The code follows the correct flow, using libcurl to fetch the HTML content and libxml2 to parse and extract the desired data using XPath expressions. It also handles potential errors and prints the bank holidays in a Markdown table format.If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
