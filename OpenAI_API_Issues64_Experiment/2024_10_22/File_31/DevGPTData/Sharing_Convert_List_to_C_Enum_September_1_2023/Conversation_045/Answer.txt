ChatGPTUnderstood. If the register address changes based on the pd parameter, then you could use a switch statement or conditional logic to select the appropriate register. The bit to be read (#7) remains constant in all cases.Here's how you could implement the isVoltageDetected function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, the switch statement determines which register address to use based on the value of pd. An Adafruit_I2CRegister object is then created for that register, and an Adafruit_I2CRegisterBit object is created to access the 7th bit. The value of this bit is then read and returned.Does this look good to you?
