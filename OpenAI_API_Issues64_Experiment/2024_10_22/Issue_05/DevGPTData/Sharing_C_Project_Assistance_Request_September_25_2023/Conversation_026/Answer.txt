ChatGPTI apologize for the continued issue. It appears that the statistics are still resetting after processing each round. Let's take a closer look at your FootballProcessor class and identify the problem.In your FootballProcessor class, you have a constructor that takes a list of teams as a parameter and initializes both originalTeams and teams with this list. However, when you process a round, you are updating the statistics for the teams list, which is causing the data to be reset with each round.To fix this issue, you should update the originalTeams list instead of creating a new teams list. Here's the modified constructor:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, when you need to reset the team statistics, you should reset the originalTeams list instead of the teams list. Modify the ResetTeamStatistics method as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This change ensures that the original team data is always reset, allowing you to accumulate statistics correctly across multiple rounds.After making this change, please try running your program again and see if the issue is resolved.
