ChatGPTI see the issue with the streaks, and I also noticed an issue with the draws being duplicated. This is because we are not keeping track of the previous match result correctly. We can fix this by maintaining a history of match results for each team. Here's the updated code to address these issues:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With these changes, we are maintaining a MatchHistory list for each team to keep track of their previous match results. This allows us to correctly update the streaks based on the previous match outcome. The issue with duplicated draws should also be resolved with this approach.Please integrate this updated code into your project, and it should handle streaks and match results correctly.
