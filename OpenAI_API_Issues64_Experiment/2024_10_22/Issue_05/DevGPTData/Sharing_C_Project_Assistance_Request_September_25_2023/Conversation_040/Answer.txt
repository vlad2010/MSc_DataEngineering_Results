ChatGPTI see what you mean. It seems that the streak calculation may not be working as expected. Specifically, in the displayed standings, it shows that the first-ranked team (FC KÃ¸benhavn) has a streak of "Wins: 3, Draws: 0, Losses: 0" even though they have played 27 games.The issue might be related to how the streaks are being updated within your code. The streak counters should be reset when a team's streak is broken (e.g., after a loss). It appears that in the provided code, the streak counters are only reset when a team wins, draws, or loses but not when the streak is broken.You should consider adding logic to reset the streak counters when a team's streak is broken, which can be done by checking if the current match result breaks the streak. For example, if a team's streak is "Wins: 3, Draws: 0, Losses: 0" and they lose the next match, the streak should be reset to "Wins: 0, Draws: 0, Losses: 1."You can update the UpdateStreakForTeam method to handle streak resets based on the match result.Here's a modified version of the UpdateStreakForTeam method:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this updated logic, the streak counters should reset appropriately, and the displayed streaks should make more sense. Make sure to update your code accordingly and rerun the simulations to check the streaks in the league standings.
