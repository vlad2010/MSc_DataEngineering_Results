ChatGPTIt seems that the formatting of the team standings when you print them in the terminal is not aligning as expected. To ensure proper alignment of the different statistics, you can use formatting placeholders when displaying the data. You already have placeholders in your Console.WriteLine statement, but it's important to ensure that the padding is set correctly for each column.Here's a modified version of the code that sets the correct padding for each column in the team standings:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code snippet, I've used formatting placeholders (e.g., {0,-5}, {1,-30}, etc.) to ensure that each column is correctly padded with spaces to align the data. Adjust the padding values as needed to achieve the desired formatting for your team standings display.
