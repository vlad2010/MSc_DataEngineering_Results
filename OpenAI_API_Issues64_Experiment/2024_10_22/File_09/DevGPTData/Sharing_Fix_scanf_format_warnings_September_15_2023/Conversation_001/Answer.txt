ChatGPTThe warnings you are encountering when using scanf are related to format specifiers not matching the type of the pointer you're using. To fix this issue and ensure your code is portable across different platforms (Linux with GCC and macOS with Clang), you should use the correct format specifier for int64_t and make sure you pass a pointer to the appropriate type.On most platforms, including Linux with GCC and macOS with Clang, int64_t is a 64-bit integer type, so you should use the %lld format specifier. However, you need to pass a pointer to int64_t when using scanf. Here's how you can do it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, we use SCNd64 for the format specifier, which is a macro from the <inttypes.h> header that corresponds to the correct format specifier for int64_t. Similarly, we use PRId64 to print the value, which is the correct format specifier for int64_t.This code should work without warnings on both Linux with GCC and macOS with Clang, ensuring portability across different platforms.
