ChatGPTThe justPressed() function will return true if the current _buttonState is different from the _lastButtonState and the current state is equal to the polarity (indicating a button press). Similarly, the justReleased() function will return true if the current _buttonState is different from the _lastButtonState and the current state is not equal to the polarity (indicating a button release).Here's the implementation for both functions:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With these functions, users can easily check if the button was just pressed or just released, taking into account the raw state and the polarity.
