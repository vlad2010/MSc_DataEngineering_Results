ChatGPTBlocking all keyboard input programmatically on macOS is a challenging task because keyboard input is a fundamental part of the operating system's functionality, and macOS is designed to prevent applications from globally blocking keyboard input for security and usability reasons.However, if you have a specific use case where you want to temporarily block keyboard input within your own application or a controlled environment, you can use a combination of platform-specific methods. Keep in mind that this approach won't block input globally across the entire system.Here's a high-level approach in C/C++ to disable keyboard input within your application using macOS's event handling system:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This code initializes the Carbon Event Manager, installs an event handler to filter out keyboard events, and consumes them within your application. It effectively blocks keyboard input for your application but won't affect other applications running on macOS.Please note that this code is a basic example and may not cover all keyboard events or handle more complex scenarios. Also, keep in mind that blocking input in this way can lead to a poor user experience and should be used sparingly and with caution.If you need to block input globally across the entire system, you would typically require administrative privileges and would need to develop a kernel-level or system-level driver, which is a highly specialized and complex task and is generally discouraged for security reasons.
