ChatGPTTo link the Carbon library with CMake, you can modify your CMakeLists.txt file to specify the required library and include directories. Here's an example of how to do this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this CMakeLists.txt file:find_library is used to locate the Carbon library, which is named "Carbon."We check if the Carbon library was found. If it's not found, we display an error message and halt the CMake configuration.We include the Carbon framework headers using include_directories. This step is necessary to include the Carbon framework's header files in your project.You can replace YourExecutableName and your_source_file.cpp with your actual project and source file names.Finally, target_link_libraries is used to link your executable with the Carbon library.Make sure to adjust the project and source file names according to your project's structure. Once you've modified your CMakeLists.txt file, you can run CMake to generate the build files, and your project should be able to link with the Carbon library.
