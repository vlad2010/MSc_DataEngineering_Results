ChatGPTI'm glad to hear that the code is not freezing anymore. Regarding the output you mentioned, it seems you didn't include the full output in your message. However, based on your previous example, I assume the output you are seeing is similar to the following:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The output indicates that libcurl tried to send the email using TLS/SSL (SMTPS) but encountered an error. Gmail requires using STARTTLS to upgrade the connection to a secure one after connecting to the SMTP server on port 587. The output shows a 530 error, indicating that Gmail expects a STARTTLS command to be issued first before authentication.To fix this, you need to explicitly tell libcurl to use STARTTLS with the CURLOPT_USE_SSL option set to CURLUSESSL_TRY and the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option set to 0L to skip certificate verification.Here's the updated C++ code:[CODE_BLOCK_1]With these changes, the code should now issue a STARTTLS command before authentication, allowing the email to be sent successfully using Gmail's SMTP server.
