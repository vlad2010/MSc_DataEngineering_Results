ChatGPTGreat! It looks like you've successfully configured dnsmasq for testing. Your configuration file specifies various useful settings for debugging and development:interface=enp113s0: The DHCP server will listen on your enp113s0 interface.dhcp-range=192.168.3.50,192.168.3.60,2m: Specifies the range of IPs dnsmasq will allocate for DHCP requests and sets the lease time to 2 minutes.user=wink and group=users: Specifies that dnsmasq will drop its root privileges and switch to the wink user and users group after starting up. Since you've also set capabilities, this should let it function with the necessary permissions without being a security risk.dhcp-leasefile=/home/wink/dnsmasq.leases: Specifies where dnsmasq will store DHCP lease information.no-daemon: Will run dnsmasq in the foreground, which is useful for debugging.port=1234 and dhcp-alternate-port=1235: Specifies alternate ports for DNS and DHCP services for debugging.Logging options: Various options to log queries and transactions.With this setup, you should be able to see any DNS queries and DHCP transactions happening on your enp113s0 interface in /home/wink/dnsmasq.log.You can now proceed to test this setup using dhclient on enp113s0 or using any other DHCP client that lets you specify a custom DHCP server port.To test, you can run:[CODE_BLOCK_0]If everything is set up correctly, you should see the log entries in /home/wink/dnsmasq.log, and dhclient should obtain an IP address in the range 192.168.3.50 to 192.168.3.60.
