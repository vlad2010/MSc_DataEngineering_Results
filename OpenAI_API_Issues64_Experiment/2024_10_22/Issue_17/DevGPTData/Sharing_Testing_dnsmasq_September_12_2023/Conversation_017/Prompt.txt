Now I actually want to test dnsmasq, I've got it running and I indicated that it's `interface=enp113s0` in the dnsmasq.conf file. Now what I think what I want to do is use dhclient to request an dhcp address. And I thought I was going to have it configure an address for enp113s0, but that is the dnsmasq's interface so that doesn't seem correct. I'm wondering if dnsmasq should be using `lo/127.0.0.1` instead and then have dhclient use enp113s0, thoughts?
