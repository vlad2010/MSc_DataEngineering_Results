ChatGPTYou can view interfaces in multiple namespaces in one command using a shell loop or by manually entering each command. However, there's no native ip command option to show interfaces across multiple namespaces in a single line.Here are a couple of approaches:Using a Bash loop:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This will loop through each namespace (ns1 and ns2), display the name of the namespace, and then list all the interfaces in it.Using a single-line shell command:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will show the interfaces in ns1 first and then those in ns2.Choose the one that you find most convenient!
