ChatGPTLet's first analyze the given code:Code - 1:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This code snippet reads an integer tt, which presumably represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers n, m, k, and H. Then, it initializes a variable ans to 0. For each of the n elements, it reads h, and if the condition (h != H && h % k == H % k && abs(h - H) <= k * (m - 1)) is satisfied, it increments the ans by 1. Finally, it prints the value of ans.Now, let's move on to the second code snippet that you'll provide. Please share the second code snippet so that we can compare the time complexity, space complexity, and other aspects to determine which one is better.
