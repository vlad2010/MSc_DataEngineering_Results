ChatGPTIn C++, you can use the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library to compile and reuse regular expressions. Here's an example of how you can accomplish this:First, make sure you have the PCRE library installed on your system and that you've included the appropriate headers in your C++ program:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Next, you can define a function that compiles a regular expression pattern and returns a pointer to the compiled pattern:[CODE_BLOCK_1]The pcre_compile function is used to compile the regular expression pattern. If the compilation fails, an error message will be printed to std::cerr. Otherwise, the compiled pattern is returned.Now, you can use the compiled pattern to perform regex matching:[CODE_BLOCK_2]The pcre_exec function is used to match the compiled pattern against the subject string. If a match is found, it prints a success message. If there is no match or an error occurs, appropriate messages are printed.Here's an example of how you can use these functions in your code:[CODE_BLOCK_3]In this example, we compile the regex pattern "hello\\s+world" and then match it against the subject string "hello world". Finally, we free the compiled pattern using pcre_free to release the allocated memory.Remember to link your program with the PCRE library during the compilation process. The specific steps for linking may depend on your platform and development environment.Note: This example uses PCRE version 8.44. If you're using a different version, the function names or parameters might vary slightly. Make sure to consult the PCRE documentation for the specific version you're using.
