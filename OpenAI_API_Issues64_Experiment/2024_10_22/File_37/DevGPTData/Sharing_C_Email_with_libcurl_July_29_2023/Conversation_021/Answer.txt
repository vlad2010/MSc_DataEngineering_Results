ChatGPTThank you for providing the code. It looks good, and you have successfully added the custom debug information to print the body of the email being sent. Now, let's proceed with the following instructions:Verify Secret File: Before running the program, please ensure that the "secret" file exists in the same folder as the program and contains the correct password for the Gmail account "watchtower.test2023@gmail.com".Remove Comment Blocks: I notice that you have commented out two lines related to SSL certificate verification (curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1L); and curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2L);). For testing purposes, please uncomment these lines to enable SSL certificate verification. Although it is not the cause of the email not being sent, it's a recommended security measure in a production environment.Check Email Delivery: After making sure the "secret" file is available and SSL verification is enabled, run the program again and observe the verbose output. It should provide debug information, including the body of the email being sent, as you added in the read_data_callback function.Examine Output: Review the verbose output to see if the body of the email is printed correctly. It will be displayed under the "[Sent Body]:" debug information.Check Spam Folder: Additionally, check the recipient's email account (in this case, "spam.mhered@gmail.com") and its spam/junk folder to see if the email is being delivered there.Debugging Output: If you encounter any issues or have concerns about the verbose output, feel free to share the updated verbose output, and I'll be happy to assist you further.By following these steps, you should be able to observe the body of the email in the verbose output and determine if there are any issues with the email content. If you still face any challenges, don't hesitate to reach out for further guidance.
