ChatGPTTo get more debug information and check that libcurl is indeed sending the body of the email, you can enable additional debug options in libcurl. One way to achieve this is by setting the CURLOPT_VERBOSE option to 1, which enables verbose output for the libcurl operations. This will provide detailed information about the request and response headers, including the email content being sent.Here's how you can modify the C++ code to enable verbose output:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By setting CURLOPT_VERBOSE to 1, libcurl will output detailed information to stderr during the execution of curl_easy_perform(). You will get extensive information about the request, response headers, and data being sent and received.Please note that the verbose output can be quite extensive and might include sensitive information such as email content and credentials. Ensure that you don't enable verbose output in a production environment or when handling sensitive data.After enabling verbose output, execute the program again and observe the output. It should provide you with more detailed information about the email being sent, which will help you identify any potential issues. If you encounter any problems or need further assistance, feel free to share the updated verbose output, and I'll be happy to help.
