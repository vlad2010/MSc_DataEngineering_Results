ChatGPTApologies for the confusion. You are right; the previous code still uses the CURLOPT_USE_SSL option, which won't work correctly with Gmail's SMTP server. Gmail requires STARTTLS for secure connections.Here's the corrected C++ code using libcurl to send an email with STARTTLS:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Now, the code uses CURLOPT_STARTTLS to ensure that STARTTLS is used to establish a secure connection before authentication, as required by Gmail's SMTP server. This should allow the email to be sent successfully using Gmail's SMTP server.
