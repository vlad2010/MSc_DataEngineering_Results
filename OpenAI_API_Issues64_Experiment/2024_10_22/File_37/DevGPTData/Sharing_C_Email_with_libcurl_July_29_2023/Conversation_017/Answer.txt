ChatGPTApologies for the confusion. If the curl command works successfully from the command line but the C++ code using libcurl doesn't send the email, there might be some other factors affecting the C++ code execution.Here are a few potential reasons why the C++ code might not be sending the email, even though the curl command works:Different Curl Versions: Ensure that the libcurl version used by the C++ code and the curl command are the same. Sometimes, different versions might behave differently.Environment Variables: Check if there are any environment variables or settings specific to curl that might be affecting its behavior. The C++ code might not have the same environment as the command line.Executable Permissions: Ensure that the C++ executable has the necessary permissions to read the secret file and establish network connections.Compiler or Linker Issues: Double-check the compilation and linking process. Make sure you are using the correct flags and libraries when compiling the C++ code.Dependencies: Verify that all necessary dependencies, including libcurl, are properly installed and accessible to the C++ code.Firewall or Antivirus Blocking: Check if any firewall or antivirus software on the system is blocking the C++ program from sending emails.Debugging: Add more debugging statements in the C++ code to print additional information about its execution, which might help identify the issue.Network Connectivity: Ensure that the network connectivity is working as expected for the C++ program to establish a connection with the SMTP server.If you have verified these points and the issue persists, consider sharing the updated C++ code, including any debugging statements you added, and the latest verbose output for further investigation. This way, I can try to help you pinpoint the exact problem.
