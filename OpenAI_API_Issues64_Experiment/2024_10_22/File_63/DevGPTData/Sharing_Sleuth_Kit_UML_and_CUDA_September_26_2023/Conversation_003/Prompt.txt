ok so this is a project now where we are going to time hfind before CUDA and hfind after CUDA on various mock or real data.  Then present our findings.  Where can I get a bunch of file hashes to do this?  Can I just get them from my C or D drive or are there any online repos, like a disk hash dump out there?
