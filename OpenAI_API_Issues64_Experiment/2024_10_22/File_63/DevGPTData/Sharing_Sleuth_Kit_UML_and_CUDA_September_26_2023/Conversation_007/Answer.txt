ChatGPTFinished workingShow workIt seems that a binsrch_index.cpp file is not present in the provided Sleuth Kit source code, based on the recursive directory walk performed.Given the circumstances, I would recommend that you try to locate the binsrch_index.cpp file or any other relevant source file on your local system or development environment, and then share the specific contents of that file here for further analysis and discussion on converting it to CUDA.If the file indeed does not exist in the source code you have, it might be worth reviewing other parts of the source code or considering alternative approaches to identify the binary search implementation or any other parallelizable components within the Sleuth Kit.
