I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question.
You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way how to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications.
Please write code where detected secutiry issue is fixed, please write all code in one fragment. 

(```cpp
__global__ void parallelBinarySearch(int* d_elements, int target, int segment_size, bool* d_found) {
    int threadId = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int start = threadId * segment_size;
    int end = start + segment_size - 1;

    int low = start, high = end;
    while(low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if(d_elements[mid] == target) {
            *d_found = true;
            return;
        }
        if(d_elements[mid] < target)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int* d_elements; // device pointer to the array of elements
    bool* d_found; // device pointer to a boolean variable indicating whether the element is found

    // ... (memory allocations and data transfers)

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    parallelBinarySearch<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_elements, target, segment_size, d_found);

    // ... (retrieve results and clean up)
}
