ChatGPTSure! I can help you modify the code to use scanf for receiving numbers instead of fgets for strings, and also modify it to send and receive numbers directly instead of strings.Here's the updated code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With these modifications, the client will now use scanf to read numbers from the user, and it will directly send and receive numbers instead of converting them to strings. The BUFFER_SIZE is set to sizeof(int) to accommodate the size of an integer. The server code should be modified accordingly to handle the received numbers.
