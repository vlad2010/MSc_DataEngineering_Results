ChatGPTThe code you provided looks good and should work to send an email using libcurl. It encapsulates the email content in the payload_text variable and sets up the EmailData struct to pass the email data to the read_data_callback function, which is used as the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback.The email content is correctly being read from the payload_text variable and sent as the request body in the email using the read_data_callback function.The rest of the code sets up the SMTP server details, including the URL, username, and password for authentication. It then performs the libcurl setup, sends the email using curl_easy_perform, and handles the response.The only thing to make sure is that you have the libcurl library installed and properly linked with your C++ program. You can do this by using the appropriate compiler flags and linking against the libcurl library during the build process.Once you have the libcurl library properly linked, the code should work as expected and send the email successfully.If you encounter any issues, please make sure that the libcurl library is installed and properly set up in your development environment. Also, ensure that the secret file is in the correct location and contains the valid password for authentication.If you encounter any specific errors or issues, feel free to share them, and I'll be happy to assist further!
