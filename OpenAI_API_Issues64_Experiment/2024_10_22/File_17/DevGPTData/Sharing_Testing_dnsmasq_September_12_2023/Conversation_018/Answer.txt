ChatGPTAh, I see what you're getting at. You want dnsmasq to listen on the loopback (lo) interface and have dhclient on enp113s0 request an IP address from that dnsmasq instance. Normally, DHCP clients broadcast their requests, which would not route beyond the local network segment (and certainly not to the loopback interface).However, if you're looking for a testing setup, you can try "tricking" dhclient into talking to your dnsmasq instance on the loopback interface. Unfortunately, dhclient itself doesn't directly allow you to specify a server IP and port to request from. However, you could perhaps set up some iptables rules to redirect the traffic for testing.Another approach could be to set up a separate network namespace. Network namespaces allow you to have isolated network stacks. In one namespace, you can run dnsmasq, and in the other, you can run dhclient. This way, they won't step on each other's toes.Here's a quick way to do it:Create Network Namespaces:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Create a Virtual Ethernet Pair:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Move the veth endpoints to the namespaces:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Set IP addresses for veth pairs and bring them up:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Run dnsmasq in one namespace:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Run dhclient in the other namespace:[CODE_BLOCK_5]This should allow you to run dnsmasq and dhclient in isolation, and you can check if the latter receives an IP address from the former.
