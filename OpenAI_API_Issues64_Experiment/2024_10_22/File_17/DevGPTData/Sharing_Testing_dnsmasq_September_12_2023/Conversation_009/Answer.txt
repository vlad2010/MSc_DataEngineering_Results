ChatGPTThe --dhcp-alternate-port option in dnsmasq allows you to change the UDP port numbers on which dnsmasq listens for DHCP and DHCPv6 requests. By default, DHCP servers listen on port 67 for DHCP requests and port 547 for DHCPv6 requests.The --dhcp-alternate-port flag takes either one or two arguments:One argument changes both the DHCP and the DHCPv6 port.Two arguments change the DHCP port and the DHCPv6 port respectively.For example, to change the DHCP port to 1067 and the DHCPv6 port to 10547, you can start dnsmasq as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Or if you want to change only the DHCP port to 1067:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Please note that using non-standard ports for DHCP may break compatibility with standard DHCP clients, as they will be expecting to find a DHCP server on the default ports. This feature is useful for debugging or for running dnsmasq in a restricted environment, but it's not suitable for a production network setup. Make sure to test this in an isolated environment to avoid issues.
