ChatGPTThe typical use case for a DHCP server is to assign IP addresses to other devices on the network. Running dhclient on the same machine where dnsmasq is running might cause confusion, especially if both are supposed to use the same network interface.However, for testing purposes, it's still possible to run both on the same machine but using different interfaces. Since dnsmasq is already set to use enp113s0, you could, in theory, use another interface for dhclient to acquire an IP address. If your machine has another interface (say enp119s0), you could try using dhclient on it.That said, you can also run dhclient on the loopback interface (lo) if you want to test it on the same machine without any network involvement. This will require you to configure dnsmasq to listen on lo instead of enp113s0.Here's a step-by-step outline of how you could set this up using lo:Update your dnsmasq configuration (dnsmasq.test.conf) to listen on the lo interface.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Assign a static IP to the loopback interface (if it doesn't have one other than 127.0.0.1).[CODE_BLOCK_1]Restart your dnsmasq instance with the new configuration.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Now use dhclient to request an IP from dnsmasq.[CODE_BLOCK_3]Remember, this setup is purely for testing. In a real-world scenario, dnsmasq and dhclient would typically not run on the same machine and certainly not on the loopback interface.Note: Since lo is a loopback interface and not a typical Ethernet interface, some behaviors may not be as expected. This is purely for testing.
