ChatGPTYes, you're correct. In the case of UDP, you can indeed use the SO_REUSEADDR socket option to allow multiple sockets to bind to the same IP address and port number. This is particularly useful for UDP multicast and broadcast, where you might want multiple applications on the same host to receive the same set of packets.Here's how you could do this in C:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this program, the setsockopt() call with the SO_REUSEADDR option allows the socket to be bound to an address and port that are already in use.You can run this program multiple times simultaneously, and they will all be able to bind to the same IP address and port.When a UDP packet is sent to that address and port, all of the sockets will receive a copy of the packet. The operating system duplicates the packet at the application level for each socket.However, please be aware that the usage of SO_REUSEADDR might behave differently between TCP and UDP, and also vary across different operating systems. Always test thoroughly and consider the implications when using this option.
