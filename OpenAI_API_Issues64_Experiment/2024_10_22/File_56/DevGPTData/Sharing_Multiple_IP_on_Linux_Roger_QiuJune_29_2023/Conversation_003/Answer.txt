ChatGPTYes, that's correct. If you assign two or more IP addresses to the same network interface, other machines on the same network can reach the original machine using any of the assigned IP addresses.Each of the IP addresses will act as an independent endpoint. Network services on the machine can be configured to listen on one, some, or all of the IP addresses. For example, you could have a web server listening on one IP address and a database server listening on another, both on the same physical machine and network interface.Keep in mind that although this offers some conveniences and can be useful in certain situations, it also increases the complexity of your network configuration and can make troubleshooting more difficult. It's important to document your network configuration well when using multiple IP addresses on a single interface.
