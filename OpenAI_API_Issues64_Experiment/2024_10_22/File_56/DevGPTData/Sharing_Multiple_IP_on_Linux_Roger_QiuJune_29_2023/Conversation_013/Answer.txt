ChatGPTYes, generally, if you bind a socket to an IP address without specifying the interface using SO_BINDTODEVICE, the operating system will make the socket receive packets sent to that IP address on any network interface.In other words, if you have two network interfaces both configured with the IP address 192.168.1.2, and you create a socket and bind it to 192.168.1.2 without specifying an interface, the socket should receive packets sent to 192.168.1.2 on either interface.Here's an example in C:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This program creates a UDP socket and binds it to the IP address 192.168.1.2 on any network interface with that IP.Again, keep in mind that having the same IP address on multiple network interfaces, especially if those interfaces are on different networks, can make your network configuration more complex and potentially lead to unexpected behavior. Be careful with this kind of setup.
