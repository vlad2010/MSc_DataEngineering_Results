The provided C++ code implements a simple stack class template. Let's analyze potential security issues and areas for improvement, along with references to applicable CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifiers. After identifying these issues, I will provide a corrected version of the code.

### Security Issues and CWEs

1. **Potential Memory Leak and Resource Mismanagement** (CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime):
    - If the `Stack` object is copied without implementing a proper copy constructor and assignment operator, it can result in a memory leak or double-free errors when destructors are called.

2. **Improper Handling of Object Assignment** (CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow):
    - The default copy constructor and assignment operator generated by the compiler perform a shallow copy, which can lead to vulnerabilities if pointers are copied directly.

3. **Uninitialized or Undefined Data** (CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable):
    - If a user provides a non-initialized `emptyValue`, the `pop()` method might return undefined behavior.

### Fixes and Improvements

To address these issues, we will implement the Rule of Three. This involves explicitly defining the copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor to manage dynamic resource allocation correctly. Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class Stack
{
private:
    T *arr;
    unsigned int cnt, maxLen;
    T emptyValue;

public:
    Stack(unsigned int stackSize, const T &emptyVal);
    ~Stack();
    Stack(const Stack &other); // Copy constructor
    Stack &operator=(const Stack &other); // Assignment operator
    void push(const T &val);
    T pop();
};

template <typename T>
Stack<T>::Stack(unsigned int stackSize, const T &emptyVal)
{
    this->arr = new T[stackSize];
    this->cnt = 0;
    this->maxLen = stackSize;
    this->emptyValue = emptyVal;
}

template <typename T>
Stack<T>::~Stack()
{
    delete[] this->arr;
}

template <typename T>
Stack<T>::Stack(const Stack &other)
    : cnt(other.cnt), maxLen(other.maxLen), emptyValue(other.emptyValue)
{
    this->arr = new T[other.maxLen];
    std::copy(other.arr, other.arr + other.cnt, this->arr);
}

template <typename T>
Stack<T> &Stack<T>::operator=(const Stack &other)
{
    if (this != &other)
    {
        delete[] this->arr; // Free existing resource

        this->cnt = other.cnt;
        this->maxLen = other.maxLen;
        this->emptyValue = other.emptyValue;

        this->arr = new T[other.maxLen];
        std::copy(other.arr, other.arr + other.cnt, this->arr);
    }
    return *this;
}

template <typename T>
void Stack<T>::push(const T &val)
{
    if (this->cnt < this->maxLen)
        this->arr[this->cnt++] = val;
    else
        std::cerr << "Error: Stack overflow." << std::endl;
}

template <typename T>
T Stack<T>::pop()
{
    if (this->cnt)
        return this->arr[--this->cnt];
    else
        return this->emptyValue; // Ensure emptyValue is properly initialized
}
```

### Key Changes

- **Rule of Three**: Implemented the copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor to handle deep copies of dynamically allocated memory.
- **Added Error Handling**: Added a basic error message in `push()` for when the stack overflows.
- **Initialization Safety**: Ensure the `emptyValue` is properly initialized by the caller to avoid returning an uninitialized value. 

This set of changes addresses potential memory management issues and ensures the `Stack` class handles dynamic allocation safely and correctly.
