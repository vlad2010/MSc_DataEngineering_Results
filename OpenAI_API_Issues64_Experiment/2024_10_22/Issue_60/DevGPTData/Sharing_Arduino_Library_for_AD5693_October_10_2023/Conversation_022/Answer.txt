ChatGPTCertainly! Below is a skeleton header file that includes the class definition and all the function prototypes we've discussed so far. This header file assumes that you're using the Adafruit BusIO library for I2C communication.[CODE_BLOCK_0]This header file defines two enums (ad5693_commands and ad5693_operating_modes) and one class (Adafruit_AD5693). The class contains public methods for initializing the device (begin), writing to the DAC (writeDAC), updating the DAC (updateDAC), writing and updating the DAC in one operation (writeUpdateDAC), resetting the device (reset), and setting the operating mode (setMode).The private member i2c_dev is a pointer to an Adafruit_I2CDevice object, which will handle the low-level I2C communication.Would you like to proceed to the next part or make any modifications?
