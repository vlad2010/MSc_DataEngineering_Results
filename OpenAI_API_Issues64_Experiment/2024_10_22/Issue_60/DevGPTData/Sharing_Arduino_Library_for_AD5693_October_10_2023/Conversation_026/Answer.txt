Here's an enhanced description for both the .h and .cpp files, providing more details about the AD5693 chip.For the .h file:[CODE_BLOCK_0]For the .cpp file:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In these updated comments, I've added information about the AD5693 being a 16-bit, single-channel, voltage-output DAC that operates over an I2C interface. This should provide a more comprehensive overview of the chip's capabilities.Would you like to proceed to the next part or make any modifications?
