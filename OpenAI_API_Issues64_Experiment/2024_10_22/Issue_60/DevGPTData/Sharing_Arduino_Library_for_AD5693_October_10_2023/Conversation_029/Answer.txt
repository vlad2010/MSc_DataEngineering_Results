ChatGPTCertainly! If any of the initialization or configuration steps fail, the sketch will enter an infinite loop to indicate the failure. I've also renamed the library object from dacDevice to ad5693. Here's the updated sketch:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated version, if any of the initialization or configuration steps fail, the sketch will enter an infinite loop (while (1) delay(10);) to halt further execution.Would you like to add anything else or make any modifications?
