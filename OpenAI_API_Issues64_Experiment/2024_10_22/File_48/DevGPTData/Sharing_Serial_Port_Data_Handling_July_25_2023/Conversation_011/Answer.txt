ChatGPTYes, we can definitely do that. In fact, it simplifies our code a bit because we don't need to remove the older samples anymore.Here is the updated addHeartRateData() method that keeps all the samples:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this change, the heart rate plot will start scrolling 10 seconds after the first data point and it will keep all the received samples. Older samples will not be visible on the plot because of the x-axis range, but they will not be discarded and will reappear if the x-axis range is manually adjusted.One thing to keep in mind with this approach is that if your program runs for a very long time and continuously receives heart rate data, the heartRateData and heartRateTime vectors will keep growing in size which could eventually cause your program to run out of memory. However, this would only be an issue if your program is running for days or even weeks without interruption and continuously receiving heart rate data.
