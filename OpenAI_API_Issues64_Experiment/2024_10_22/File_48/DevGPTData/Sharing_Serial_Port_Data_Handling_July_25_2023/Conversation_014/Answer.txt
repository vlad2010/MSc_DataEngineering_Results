ChatGPTYou can add titles to your plots using the plotLayout property of the QCustomPlot object. The plotLayout property provides a grid layout where you can add elements like titles, axis rect backgrounds, etc.Here's how you can add titles to your plots:For the ECG plot, add the following line in your MainWindow constructor, after you have created ecgPlot:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Similarly, for the heart rate plot, add the following line in your MainWindow constructor, after you have created heartRatePlot:[CODE_BLOCK_1]The insertRow() function adds a new empty row above the default axis rect. Then, addElement() is used to add a new QCPTextElement to this row, which will be our title. The QCPTextElement constructor takes three parameters: the parent plot, the text of the title, and the font. We use a bold sans-serif font of size 12 for the title.Remember to include the header for QCPTextElement at the beginning of your mainwindow.cpp file:[CODE_BLOCK_2]With these changes, each plot will have a title displayed above the plot area.
