ChatGPTAbsolutely, let's work on the heart rate plot.First, you need to make sure that the serial port reader is correctly emitting the newHeartRateData signal when it reads a heart rate value from the serial port. Please check if that's happening.Next, in the MainWindow constructor, let's initialize the heart rate plot similarly to the ECG plot:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, in the addHeartRateData() slot, we need to do something similar to what we did in addECGData(). Let's add a new data point, remove the oldest point if necessary, adjust the x-axis range, and update the plot:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Note that I'm assuming the heart rate data comes at a frequency of 1Hz (once per second), so we keep the last 10 data points to match the 10-second duration of the x-axis range. Please adjust this according to the actual frequency of your heart rate data.
