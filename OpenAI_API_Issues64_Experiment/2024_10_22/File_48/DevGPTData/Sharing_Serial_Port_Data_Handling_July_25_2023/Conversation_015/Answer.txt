ChatGPTYou can add markers to your heart rate plot in the form of "scatter points". In QCustomPlot, these are achieved by setting a scatter style for the plot's graph. Here is how you can modify the MainWindow constructor to set a scatter style for the heart rate graph:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Here, setScatterStyle(QCPScatterStyle::ssDisc, 5) sets the scatter style to "disc" with a size of 5. The size value will determine the size of the scatter points (markers). You can change the scatter style and size according to your needs. You can find more options for the scatter style in the QCPScatterStyle documentation.
