ChatGPTYes, you can certainly remove the scrolling feature from the heart rate plot. The code simplifies even further:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This modification will cause the heart rate plot to automatically adjust both axes as new data is received, effectively showing all received data on the plot. If you want to limit the range of the y-axis to a certain interval (for instance, from 0 to 200), you can call setRangeLower() and setRangeUpper() on the y-axis after calling rescale(), like this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will keep the y-axis range between 0 and 200 while still fitting all data points on the x-axis. Adjust the range according to your needs.And remember, now that you are not discarding any data, the heartRateData and heartRateTime vectors will grow as more data is received. If your application runs for an extended period of time, you may need to manage this memory growth.
