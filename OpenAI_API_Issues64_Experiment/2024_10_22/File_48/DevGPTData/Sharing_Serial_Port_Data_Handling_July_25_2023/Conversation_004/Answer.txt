ChatGPTAlright. To set the range of y-axis from -600 to 600, you can call setRange() on the y-axis like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]For the x-axis, let's say we want to display 1 second of data at a time, because the data is sampled at 360Hz. You can set the x-axis range to 0 to 1 initially:[CODE_BLOCK_1]To make the data scroll, we need to adjust the range of the x-axis each time we add a new data point. We can check if the last key (time value) is greater than the upper limit of the current range, and if so, shift the range to the right by 1 second.Update the addECGData() method like this:[CODE_BLOCK_2]This will make your ECG plot display the latest 1 second of data and discard the oldest samples as new ones come in.For the heart rate data, depending on the frequency of data arrival and the range of values, you may need to adjust the axes ranges and the scroll behavior similarly.
