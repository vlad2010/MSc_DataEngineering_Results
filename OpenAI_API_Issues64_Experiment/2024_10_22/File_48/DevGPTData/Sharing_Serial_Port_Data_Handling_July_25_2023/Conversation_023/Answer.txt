ChatGPTYes, you can adjust the position of the QCPItemText to be on top of the data marker by changing the alignment to Qt::AlignHCenter|Qt::AlignBottom and adjusting the setPixelPosition method accordingly.Here's how you can modify the label's position in the addHeartRateData() method:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, Qt::AlignHCenter|Qt::AlignBottom aligns the center of the label horizontally with the marker, and places the bottom edge of the label at the y-coordinate of the marker. The QPoint(0, -10) offset moves the label 10 pixels up from its current position. Adjust the QPoint values to increase or decrease the space as needed.
