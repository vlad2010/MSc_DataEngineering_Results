ChatGPTYes, you can increase the amount of space between the data marker and the label by adding an offset to the QCPItemText's position. This can be done using the setPixelPosition() method, which moves the position by a specified number of pixels from its current position.Here's how you can adjust the label's position in the addHeartRateData() method:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, setPixelPosition() is called with the current pixel position of the QCPItemText plus an QPoint offset. The QPoint(10, 0) offset moves the label 10 pixels to the right from its current position. Adjust the QPoint values to increase or decrease the space as needed.
