ChatGPTIt seems there is a syntax error in the code snippet you provided. The function strcmp is used to compare two strings in C or C++, but the syntax used is incorrect.To compare two strings using strcmp, you should use the following syntax:[CODE_BLOCK_0]When you run this code, the output value will be a numeric value indicating the result of the string comparison:If result is 0, it means the strings are equal.If result is negative, it means str1 is less than str2.If result is positive, it means str1 is greater than str2.
