ChatGPTIn Java, interface fields are implicitly public, static, and final. So, the correct equivalent code for line 3 is:final int k = 4;Options 2, 3, 4, and 5 are not equivalent because:public int k = 4;The field in an interface is already public by default, so adding the "public" modifier is redundant.static int k = 4;The field in an interface is already static by default, so adding the "static" modifier is redundant.abstract int k = 4;Interface fields cannot be declared as abstract. They are implicitly final and cannot be changed by implementing classes.protected int k = 4;Interface fields cannot have the "protected" access modifier. They are implicitly public and cannot have any other access modifier.
