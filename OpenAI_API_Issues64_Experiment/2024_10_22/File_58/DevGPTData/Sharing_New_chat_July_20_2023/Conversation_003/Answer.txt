ChatGPTYes, in the provided code, the buffer is declared as an array of characters (char), so it is currently receiving and storing data as a character string.The line char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]; declares the buffer to be an array of characters with a maximum size of BUFFER_SIZE. It means the buffer is used to store a sequence of characters terminated by the null character ('\0'), making it essentially a character string.Each time you use fgets to read input from the user or receive data from the server, the data is treated as a character string.If you want to store the data as integers instead of characters, you should change the data type of the buffer array to an array of integers (int). To do this, you need to change the data type and update the necessary parts of the code where the buffer is used to handle integer data.If you would like to modify the code to receive and store data as integers, please let me know, and I can help you with the necessary changes.
