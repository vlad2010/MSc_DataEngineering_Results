ChatGPTOf course, I'll add comments back in to clarify which bits are being accessed in each function. Here are the updated functions:Function to get the "attached" status[CODE_BLOCK_0]Function to get the "CC_DIR" status[CODE_BLOCK_1]Function to get the PD response codes[CODE_BLOCK_2]Function to get the 5V contract voltage status[CODE_BLOCK_3]Function to get the 5V current contract[CODE_BLOCK_4]Each function now includes comments specifying which bits are being accessed. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
