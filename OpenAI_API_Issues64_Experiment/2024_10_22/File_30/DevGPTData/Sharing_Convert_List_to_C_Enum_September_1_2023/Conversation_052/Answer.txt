ChatGPTCertainly! The getSourceCapabilities function will write the value 0b00100 to the GO_COMMAND register.Here's how you could implement this function:Function to get source capabilities[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, an Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits object is used to access bits 2 and 3 (bit indexes 2 and 3) of the GO_COMMAND register. We then write 0b00100 to those bits to request source capabilities.Does this function meet your requirements?
