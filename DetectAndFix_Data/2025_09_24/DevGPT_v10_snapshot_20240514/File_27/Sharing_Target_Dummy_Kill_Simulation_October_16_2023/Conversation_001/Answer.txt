To write a C++ program that simulates hitting a target dummy in a video game and measures how long it takes to kill it, you'll need to create a simple game loop. Here's a basic outline of how you can approach this task:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This program defines a `TargetDummy` class with health, allows it to take damage, and checks if it's alive. In the main function, it repeatedly damages the target dummy until it's dead and measures the time it took to kill it.

Make sure to adjust the initial health, damage per hit, and any other parameters to match your game's specifications. You can also introduce artificial delays to simulate game ticks or frames, as noted in the code comments.

This is a simplified example, and in a real game, you would need to consider various factors like player skills, weapon stats, and possibly more complex game mechanics.
