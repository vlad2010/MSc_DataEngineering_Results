I see your point. You can introduce a separate variable to track when the ability last dealt damage and modify the `canDealDamage` function accordingly. Here's the updated code:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This code tracks the last damage time separately and modifies the `canDealDamage` function accordingly, ensuring that abilities can deal damage based on their cooldowns. If an ability is inactive, it is cast immediately.
