You're absolutely correct. I apologize for the oversight. Here's the corrected constructor:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Thank you for pointing that out, and I appreciate your understanding.
Seconds = static_cast<double>(ticks - 1) / ticksPerSecond;
    std::cout << "Target dummy killed in " << totalElapsedTimeSeconds << " seconds." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code now includes the individual cooldown and shared cooldown mechanism, cool ability names, and prints out health, ability names, current tick, and time as requested.
 1.0 / ticksPerSecond;
        }

        elapsedTimeSeconds += 1.0 / ticksPerSecond;
        ticks++;
    }

    double totalElapsedTimeSeconds = static_cast<double>(ticks - 1) / ticksPerSecond;
    std::cout << "Target dummy killed in " << totalElapsedTimeSeconds << " seconds." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code includes the changes you requested, such as individual cooldowns, cool ability names, and the option to adjust `sharedCooldownValue` and `ticksPerSecond`. It prints the health, ability names, current tick, and time as specified.
