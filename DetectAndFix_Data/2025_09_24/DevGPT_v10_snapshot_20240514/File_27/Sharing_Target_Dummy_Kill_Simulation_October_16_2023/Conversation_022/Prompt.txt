What I'd like is for the ability to only be treated as being cast every (duration) seconds. When it is cast, set a variable to True to indicate it is active. Then once (duration) seconds have passed, the variable should be updated to indicate it's no longer active. The main loop should, for each ability, check if it's active, then if (cooldown) seconds have passed since it last dealt damage, deal the damage. If it's inactive, it should cast the ability and immediately deal damage.
