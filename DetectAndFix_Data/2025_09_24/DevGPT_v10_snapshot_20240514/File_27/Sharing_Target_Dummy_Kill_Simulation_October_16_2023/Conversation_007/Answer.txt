I apologize for the oversight. If you want to remove the sleep between each tick and eliminate the random number generation, you can modify the code as follows:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this code, the sleep between ticks has been removed, and the random number generation is no longer present. The program calculates the time it takes to kill the dummy in terms of in-game ticks without any wall clock time delays.
