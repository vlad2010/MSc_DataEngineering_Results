Certainly! Let's break down the code and simplify it:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Key Simplifications:
1. Removed duplicate include statements.
2. Used `unordered_map` instead of a custom `hashMap` (assuming it's similar to an unordered_map).
3. Simplified the file handling and variable initialization.
4. Replaced `it.second()` with `it->second` and `it.first()` with `it->first` for correct syntax.
5. Removed unnecessary `infile.ignore()` statements.
6. Simplified vote counting using `votes[vote]++`.
7. Used `auto` for iterator type to simplify.
8. Simplified tie-checking conditions.

This code reads input from a file, processes voting data for multiple cases, and determines the winner or if there's a tie. It uses unordered maps to store party information and vote counts.
