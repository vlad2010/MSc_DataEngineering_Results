Certainly! Let's review the code again and make some additional simplifications:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Additional Simplifications:

2. Used a structured binding in the loop to simplify code when iterating over the votes.
3. Removed `currentVotes` variable as it's not necessary.

These changes make the code more concise and eliminate unnecessary parts.
