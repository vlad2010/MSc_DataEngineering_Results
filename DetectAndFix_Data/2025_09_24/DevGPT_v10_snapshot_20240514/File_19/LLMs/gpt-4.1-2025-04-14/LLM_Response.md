Certainly! Here is a security review of your C++ code, with formal vulnerability classifications (CWE numbers), analysis, and a fixed version of the code.

## Security Issues Identified

### 1. **Unchecked File Input (CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value)**
You do not check if the file was opened successfully. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, the program will proceed and may cause undefined behavior.

### 2. **Unchecked Input Extraction (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation)**
You do not check if input extraction operations (e.g., `infile >> cases;`) succeed. If the file is malformed, this can lead to logic errors or crashes.

### 3. **Uninitialized Variable Use (CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable)**
`maxVotes` is not reset for each case, so its value may carry over from previous cases, leading to incorrect results.

### 4. **Potential Out-of-Bounds Map Access (CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast)**
When accessing `parties[candidate]`, if `candidate` is not in the map, it will insert a default value. This can lead to incorrect results or logic errors.

### 5. **No Input Sanitization (CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output)**
User input is not sanitized or validated, which could lead to logic errors or, in some contexts, injection attacks.

### 6. **Resource Leak (CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime)**
The file stream is not explicitly closed, though it will be closed when the object goes out of scope. Explicitly closing is a good practice.

| Uninitialized variable use | CWE-457 | `maxVotes` not reset per case | Reset `maxVotes` each case |
| Out-of-bounds map access | CWE-704 | Accessing non-existent map keys | Check with `.find()` before access |
| No input sanitization | CWE-116 | Input not validated | Check input extraction and handle errors |
| Resource leak | CWE-772 | File not explicitly closed | Call `infile.close()` |
