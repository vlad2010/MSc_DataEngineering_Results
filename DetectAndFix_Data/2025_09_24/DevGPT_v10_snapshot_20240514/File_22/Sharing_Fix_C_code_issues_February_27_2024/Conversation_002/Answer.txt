Your code indeed has some duplication and nesting issues. Let's address them:

1. **Duplication in input validation**: The input validation logic appears in both the `checkCellChoice` and `validateCell` functions. We can consolidate this logic into a single function to avoid duplication.

2. **Nested loops for computer's cell selection**: The nested loops in the computer's cell selection process can be simplified.

3. **DebugMode printing**: The debug mode printing statements can be streamlined.

Here's the refactored code addressing these issues:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this refactored version, the duplication is reduced, and the nesting is simplified for better readability and maintenance.
