Certainly! Here's an example of how you can create a listener in C++ using the Windows API to monitor process creation and extract the name of the process. This code utilizes the `SetWindowsHookEx` function to set a hook that captures process creation events.

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this code, we set a Windows Shell hook (`WH_SHELL`) by calling `SetWindowsHookEx`. The hook procedure, `HookCallback`, is called whenever a process is created. Inside the callback, we use `GetWindowTextA` to extract the name of the process from the window handle.

The main loop of the program runs until the message queue is empty. This allows the program to continuously monitor process creation events. Finally, we unhook the hook by calling `UnhookWindowsHookEx` to clean up.

Please note that to compile and run this code successfully, you will need to link against the user32.lib library.
