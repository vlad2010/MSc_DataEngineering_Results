The table from the uploaded CSV file appears to have a structure where the first row might represent column headers, but it's not formatted correctly for automatic parsing. The data seems to represent cadence values at various resistance levels, with the first column likely indicating the resistance level and the following columns showing corresponding wattage for cadences ranging from 10 to 100. There seems to be an issue with the semicolon (`;`) used as a delimiter, and possibly extra semicolons indicating missing or undefined values for higher cadences.

I'll attempt to properly parse this table by treating the semicolon as the delimiter and handling the irregular structure to display the information more clearly.
Here is the correctly parsed table from the uploaded CSV file, showing the wattage at various cadences for different resistance levels:

| Resistance | 20 W | 30 W | 40 W | 50 W | 60 W | 70 W | 80 W | 90 W | 100 W |
|------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1          | 21   | 30   | 41   | 51   | 61   | 72   | 81   | 92   | 101   |
| 2          | 34   | 39   | 53   | 65   | 80   | 94   | 106  | 119  | 133   |
| 3          | 39   | 49   | 65   | 85   | 100  | 113  | 132  | 149  | 166   |
| 4          | 44   | 58   | 81   | 100  | 120  | 140  | 156  | 179  | 198   |

The table's rows represent different resistance levels (1 through 4), and the columns represent the wattage output at cadences from 20 to 100. Note that the first row appears to be a header or title row, incorrectly parsed into the data; it should be disregarded in the context of the wattage data.
