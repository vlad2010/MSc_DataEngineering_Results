Yes, it's possible to construct and send packets with custom headers, including IP and TCP headers, in C. However, it requires careful manipulation of the packet structure and adherence to the protocols' specifications. Here's a simplified example of how you might construct and send a TCP packet with custom headers:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This example constructs an IPv4 packet with a TCP header and sends it raw over a socket. Note that constructing custom headers requires detailed knowledge of the respective protocols' specifications. You also need to calculate the checksums for both the IP and TCP headers, which I've omitted for simplicity.

Remember that sending raw packets requires special privileges, and you need to run this program with appropriate permissions. Additionally, sending raw packets may bypass firewall rules and could potentially be restricted or blocked in certain environments or network configurations. Always use caution and adhere to applicable laws and regulations.
