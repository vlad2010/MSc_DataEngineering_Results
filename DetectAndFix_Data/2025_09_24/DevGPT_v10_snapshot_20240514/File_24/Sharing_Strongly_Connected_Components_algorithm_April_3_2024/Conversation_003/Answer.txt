To avoid stack overflow issues with large networks when using recursion in C++, especially in the context of algorithms like Tarjan's for finding strongly connected components, it's often advisable to switch to an iterative approach. This change typically involves using an explicit stack to manage the recursive calls that would otherwise be managed implicitly by the call stack. 

Given the complexity and the specific details of the provided code, here's a general approach to refactor the recursive part of the `strongconnect` function into an iterative form. This involves introducing a manual stack to keep track of the nodes and their states during the depth-first search (DFS). The goal is to mimic the call stack behavior of the recursive implementation with an explicit stack.

### General Strategy:

1. **Manual Stack Management**: Use a stack to manually manage nodes during DFS. Each element on the stack will contain not only the node but also a state indicating which part of the "recursive" process you're in.

2. **Node Processing State**: Each node can be in one of several states indicating whether it's being visited for the first time, if it's in the process of visiting its neighbors, or if it's completing. This is akin to the recursive function entering, processing, and exiting.

3. **Iteration over Successors**: Instead of recursively calling `strongconnect` for each neighbor, iterate over each neighbor in the current stack frame. When encountering a neighbor that needs processing, push a new frame onto the stack for that neighbor.

This approach eliminates the recursion and, consequently, the risk of a stack overflow error. Below is a sketch of how this could be implemented, focusing on the iterative process. Note that due to the complexity and specificity of the provided code, the following example simplifies the logic for illustrative purposes and needs to be adapted to fit the actual implementation details.

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This sketch provides a general direction for converting the recursive `strongConnect` function into an iterative form. The actual implementation will require careful handling of the algorithm's logic, especially around managing indices, the onStackFlag, and forming strongly connected components. Adapting this approach to your specific code structure and requirements will be necessary.
