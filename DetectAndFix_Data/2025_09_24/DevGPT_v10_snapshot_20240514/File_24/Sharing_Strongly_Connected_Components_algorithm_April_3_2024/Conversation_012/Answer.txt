I was unable to directly access the specific content of the `ConnectedParts.cpp` file from the GeoDMS project on GitHub within the scope of this environment. To compare the provided code with the implementation in the GeoDMS project, you would typically review the logic related to the iterative approach for handling strongly connected components, focusing on how nodes and edges are managed, the use of data structures like stacks, and the update mechanisms for indices and flags.

Key aspects to compare might include:
- The structure and purpose of the `Frame` struct and how each frame is processed.
- How nodes are added to the stack and how the algorithm ensures that all nodes in a strongly connected component are correctly identified.
- The conditionals for processing successors, updating indices, and identifying when a strongly connected component is complete.
- The use of flags such as `processSuccessor` and control flow mechanisms like `goto` for managing the iterative deepening of the search.

For a detailed comparison, I recommend examining the specific lines (291 to 401) of `ConnectedParts.cpp` in the GeoDMS project's v14 branch, focusing on the implementation details of Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components. Pay particular attention to any optimizations or unique approaches used in GeoDMS that might differ from the conventional implementation discussed here.
