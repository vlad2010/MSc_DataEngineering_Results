Upon closer inspection, the lines updating `frame.currentLink` and `frame.processSuccessor` at the end of the loop are indeed unnecessary and incorrect in the context provided. Since `frame` is a reference to the top element of `stack`, any changes made to `currentLink` and `processSuccessor` are already applied directly to this top element. Therefore, explicitly updating these fields in `frame` at the end of the loop is redundant and may lead to confusion.

Let's remove those lines to clarify the loop's logic and ensure the code correctly reflects the algorithm's iterative structure.

### Simplified and Corrected Code

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

By removing the unnecessary updates to `frame.currentLink` and `frame.processSuccessor`, this version directly manipulates the top frame of the stack, which simplifies the code and avoids potential errors associated with redundant or incorrect updates. This adjustment ensures that the code more accurately and effectively implements the iterative version of Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm.
