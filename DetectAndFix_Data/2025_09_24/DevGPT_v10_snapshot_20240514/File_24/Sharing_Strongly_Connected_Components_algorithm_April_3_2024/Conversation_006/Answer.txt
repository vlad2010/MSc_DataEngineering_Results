Refining the approach further by eliminating the `isFirstVisit` flag and adjusting the logic as you've described, we can streamline the iterative implementation of Tarjan's algorithm. We will also correct the minimization of `indices[v].second` to use `indices[w].second` within the `processSuccessor` condition and acknowledge that this minimization should occur regardless of whether `onStackFlag[w]` is true.

Let's adjust the code based on these optimizations:

### Further Optimized Iterative Approach

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This version simplifies the loop by:
- Removing the `isFirstVisit` flag. Initialization for a node `v` is performed immediately before it's pushed onto the stack, ensuring that the setup code is executed only once per node at the correct time.
- Correcting the condition within the `processSuccessor` logic to always minimize `indices[v].second` with `indices[w].second`, addressing the issue with the previous version where it incorrectly minimized with `indices[w].first` and only under certain conditions.
- Including a loop to start the depth-first search (DFS) from each unvisited node, ensuring that the algorithm explores all nodes in the graph.

This revised approach keeps the algorithm's iterative nature while incorporating the necessary corrections and optimizations you've highlighted, ensuring correctness and efficiency.
