in the main loop, if IsDefined(indices[w].first) was true, the else branch should not set processSuccor, and only update  indices[v].second = = std::min(indices[v].second, indices[w].first if (onStackFlag[w].value()). See this code snippet:
	if (!IsDefined(indices[w].first))
	{
		// Successor w has not yet been visited; recurse on it
		strongconnect(w);
		MakeMin(indices[v].second, indices[w].second);
	}
	else if (onStackFlag[w].value())
		// Successor w is in stack S and hence in the current SCC
		// If w is not on stack, then (v, w) is an edge pointing to an SCC already found and must be ignored
		// The next line may look odd - but is correct.
		// It says w.index not w.lowlink; that is deliberate and from the original paper
		MakeMin(indices[v].second, indices[w].first);
