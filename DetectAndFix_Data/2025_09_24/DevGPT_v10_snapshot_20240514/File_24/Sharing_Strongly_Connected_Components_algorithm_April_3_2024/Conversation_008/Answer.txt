You've highlighted important aspects to ensure the code's robustness and correctness, especially considering how modifications to a container (like `push_back` on a vector) can invalidate references. Let's adjust the code accordingly:

1. Move the `processSuccessor = true;` statement before the `stack.push_back()` call to avoid invalidating the reference.
2. Simplify the logic inside the loop by removing the unnecessary `!processSuccessor` condition in the second `if` statement because, at that point, `processSuccessor` will always be `false` due to either being reset earlier or not being set within the current iteration.

### Revised and Optimized Code

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this version:
- The `processSuccessor = true;` statement is moved above `stack.push_back()`, safeguarding against potential reference invalidation.
- The condition checking `!processSuccessor` in the loop is removed, simplifying the control flow, as `processSuccessor` is managed explicitly and resets appropriately within the loop, ensuring that the code logic remains clear and precise.

These adjustments make the code more robust, particularly in handling the dynamic nature of the stack vector, and streamline the control flow within the main loop for clarity and efficiency.
