Let's refine the earlier version by incorporating a `goto` statement to efficiently manage the loop and continue processing with a fresh frame reference. This adjustment aims to preserve the logic around `processSuccessor` and ensure that `indices[v].second` is updated correctly, while also handling potential reference invalidation issues properly after a new frame is pushed onto the stack.

### Refined Code with Goto

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

### Key Adjustment:
- **Goto for Loop Management**: Instead of breaking out of the loop, we use a `goto CHECK_CURRENT_LINK;` statement. This allows us to jump back to the point where the code checks if `currentLink` is defined, with the correct handling of the stack to ensure references are valid. The `goto` statement is used here to efficiently manage control flow within the loop, especially after modifying the stack, which could invalidate references.
  
This refined approach maintains the necessary logic for updating `indices[v].second` and handling the dynamic stack structure, ensuring that all references are valid and the logic accurately reflects the algorithm's requirements.
