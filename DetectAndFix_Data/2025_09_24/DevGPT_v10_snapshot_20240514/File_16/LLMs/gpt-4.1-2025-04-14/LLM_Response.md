Certainly! Here’s a security review of your C++ code snippet, with formal CWE references and a secure rewrite.

Original Code:
```cpp
cout << "Enter filename: ";
cin >> filename;
ifstream infile(filename);
infile >> cases;
```

Security Issues Identified

1. **Unvalidated User Input (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation)**
   - The filename is taken directly from user input without validation. This can allow path traversal attacks (e.g., entering `../../etc/passwd`), potentially exposing sensitive files.

2. **Missing Error Handling (CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value)**
   - The code does not check if the file was opened successfully. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, `infile >> cases;` may lead to undefined behavior.

3. **Potential Buffer Overflow (CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input)**
   - If `filename` is a fixed-size char array, `cin >> filename;` can overflow it. (Assuming `filename` is a `std::string` avoids this, but if not, it’s a risk.)

4. **Information Exposure (CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)**
   - If error messages or file contents are printed without sanitization, sensitive information could be leaked. (Not shown here, but relevant if you add error messages.)

Secure Version

Below is a secure rewrite, assuming `filename` is a `std::string` and `cases` is an `int`. The code validates the filename, checks for file open errors, and restricts path traversal.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <regex>

int main() {
    std::string filename;
    int cases;

    std::cout << "Enter filename: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, filename);

    // Validate filename: allow only alphanumeric, underscore, dash, and dot, no path separators
    std::regex valid_filename("^[\\w\\-.]+$");
    if (!std::regex_match(filename, valid_filename)) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid filename. Only alphanumeric characters, underscores, dashes, and dots are allowed." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Prevent path traversal by rejecting filenames with ".."
    if (filename.find("..") != std::string::npos) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid filename: path traversal detected." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::ifstream infile(filename);
    if (!infile.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not open file '" << filename << "'." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    if (!(infile >> cases)) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Failed to read 'cases' from file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "Cases read: " << cases << std::endl;
    // ... rest of your code ...
    return 0;
}
```

Summary of Fixes

- **Input validation**: Only allows safe filenames, blocks path traversal.
- **Error handling**: Checks if file opens and if reading succeeds.
- **Safe input**: Uses `std::string` and `std::getline` to avoid buffer overflow.
- **CWE references**: CWE-20, CWE-252, CWE-120, CWE-200.
