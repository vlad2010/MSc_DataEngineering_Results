To write a function in C that converts an integer to a string representation with commas for thousands separators, you need to handle a few key steps:

1. Determine the length of the string required.
2. Convert the integer to a string without commas.
3. Insert commas appropriately.

Here's an implementation in C:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This function works as follows:

1. It uses `sprintf` to convert the integer to a string without commas.
2. It calculates the number of commas needed and the final string length.
3. It allocates memory for the final string and checks for allocation failure.
4. It then iterates through the initial string and copies characters to the final string, inserting commas at appropriate positions.
5. Finally, it returns the resulting string. Note that it's the responsibility of the caller to free the allocated memory.

This function only handles positive integers. If you need to handle negative integers, you'll need to add additional logic to handle the sign.
