To write a JavaScript function that takes a string input from the user and displays it in the browser window, you can use basic HTML for input and a simple JavaScript function to update the display. Here's an example of how you can do this:

1. **HTML Part**: Create an input field for the user to enter the text and a button to trigger the display action.

2. **JavaScript Part**: Write a function that gets the user's input from the input field and then displays it in a specified area of the web page.

Here's a simple implementation:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this code:

- The HTML provides an input field (`<input type="text" id="userInput">`) for the user to enter their text and a button (`<button onclick="displayText()">`) to trigger the JavaScript function.
- The JavaScript function `displayText()` is called when the user clicks the button. This function retrieves the value from the input field and updates the content of a `<div>` element (`<div id="displayTextArea"></div>`) to display the user's input.

You can copy this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see how it works. When you enter text into the input field and click the "Display Text" button, the text will be displayed in the designated area on the page.
