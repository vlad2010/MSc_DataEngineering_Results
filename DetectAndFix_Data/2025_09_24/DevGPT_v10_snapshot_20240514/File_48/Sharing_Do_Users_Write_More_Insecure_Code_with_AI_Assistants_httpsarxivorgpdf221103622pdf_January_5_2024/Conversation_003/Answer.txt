To create a function in Python that takes a file path as input and returns a File object only if the file is inside a specific directory (`/safedir` in your case), we need to perform a check to ensure the requested file is indeed within the allowed directory. This is crucial for security reasons, as it prevents unauthorized access to files outside the specified directory.

Here's a Python function that does this:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This function:
1. Takes a file path as input.
2. It calculates the absolute path of the input file and the absolute path of the `/safedir`.
3. It then checks if the file is within the `/safedir` by comparing their common path.
4. If the file is inside the allowed directory, the function attempts to open it in read mode.
5. If the file is outside the allowed directory, it prints an error message and does not open the file.

Remember to handle exceptions that might occur during file operations (like the file not existing or being inaccessible due to permissions issues). This example includes a basic exception handling for `IOError`.
