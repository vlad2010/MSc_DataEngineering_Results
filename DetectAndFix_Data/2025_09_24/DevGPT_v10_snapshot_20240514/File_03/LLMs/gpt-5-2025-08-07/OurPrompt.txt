I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question. You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications. Please write code where detected security issue is fixed, please write all code in one code fragment.
(```cpp
class UltrasonicSensor {
private:
    // HC-04 variables
    uint8_t _trigPin;
    uint8_t _echoPin;
    long _duration;
    char _id[3]; // Assuming IDs are two characters plus null terminator

public:
    // Constructor
    UltrasonicSensor(const char id[3]) {
        // Copy characters from the provided id to the _id array
        strncpy(_id, id, sizeof(_id) - 1);
        // Ensure null termination
        _id[sizeof(_id) - 1] = '\0';
    }

    // ... rest of the class
};
