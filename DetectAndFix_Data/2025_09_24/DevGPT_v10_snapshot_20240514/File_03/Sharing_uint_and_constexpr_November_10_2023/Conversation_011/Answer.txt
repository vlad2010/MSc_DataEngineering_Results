No, there is no standard `uint4_t` type in the C or C++ standard libraries. The fixed-width integer types provided by the `<cstdint>` header include `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, and `uint64_t`, but there is no standard 4-bit unsigned integer type.

If you need a 4-bit unsigned integer type, you might need to use bit manipulation with standard types like `unsigned char` or use a bit-field within a struct. However, keep in mind that the size of `unsigned char` is not fixed (it is guaranteed to be at least 8 bits), so this approach might not provide a strictly 4-bit type on all systems.

In practice, working with fixed-width types like `uint8_t` or larger types might be more convenient and portable, as they align more closely with the native word size of most modern architectures. If precise bit-level manipulation is crucial, you may need to resort to bit fields or other bitwise operations with standard types.
