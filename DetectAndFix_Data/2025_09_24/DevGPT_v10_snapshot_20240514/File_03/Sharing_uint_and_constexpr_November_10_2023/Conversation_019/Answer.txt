Both `constexpr` and `#define` can be used for defining constants in C++, but they have some key differences in terms of scope, type safety, and compile-time evaluation.

### 1. **Scope and Type Safety:**

- **`constexpr`:**
  - Follows the C++ scoping rules, providing better encapsulation.
  - Respects the type system and performs type checking.
  - Variables defined with `constexpr` have a well-defined scope within the block or function where they are declared.

- **`#define`:**
  - Uses textual substitution and lacks scoping.
  - Does not respect the type system and performs no type checking.
  - Constants defined with `#define` have global scope and can lead to naming collisions.

### 2. **Compile-Time Evaluation:**

- **`constexpr`:**
  - Supports evaluation at compile time when used in contexts that require constant expressions.
  - Enables the compiler to perform optimizations based on the known constant value.

[CODE_BLOCK_2]

- **`#define`:**
  - Generally lacks explicit support for compile-time evaluation.
  - The value is substituted textually during the preprocessing phase.

[CODE_BLOCK_3]

### 3. **Type Information:**

- **`constexpr`:**
  - Respects the type system, and the type is explicitly specified.
  - Provides better type safety and avoids unexpected behaviors.

[CODE_BLOCK_4]

- **`#define`:**
  - Does not provide explicit type information; it is textually substituted.

[CODE_BLOCK_5]

### 4. **Debugging and Readability:**

- **`constexpr`:**
  - Debugging is generally easier as the constants have a specific type and scope.
  - Readable and consistent with modern C++ code.

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

- **`#define`:**
  - Debugging can be more challenging because `#define` constants are textually replaced.
  - May be less readable, especially for more complex expressions.

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

### Conclusion:

- Use `constexpr` for defining constants whenever possible in modern C++ code. It provides better scoping, type safety, and supports compile-time evaluation.

- Use `#define` only when `constexpr` is not applicable, such as in preprocessor directives or when backward compatibility is essential.

For example:

[CODE_BLOCK_8]

In modern C++ code, `constexpr` is generally the preferred choice for defining constants due to its type safety, scoping, and support for compile-time evaluation.
