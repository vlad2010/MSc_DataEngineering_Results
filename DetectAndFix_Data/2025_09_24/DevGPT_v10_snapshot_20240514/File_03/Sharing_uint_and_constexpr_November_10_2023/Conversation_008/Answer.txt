The sizes of the `size_t` and `uintX_t` types depend on the implementation and architecture of the system. However, I can provide general information based on common conventions:

1. **`size_t`**: The size of `size_t` is typically chosen by the compiler to be large enough to represent the maximum size of the largest possible object that can exist in the program. On most modern systems, `size_t` is 32 bits (4 bytes) on 32-bit systems and 64 bits (8 bytes) on 64-bit systems.

2. **`uint8_t`**: The size of `uint8_t` is fixed and is exactly 8 bits (1 byte) on all systems. It's explicitly designed to be an 8-bit unsigned integer.

3. **`uint16_t`**: The size of `uint16_t` is fixed at 16 bits (2 bytes).

4. **`uint32_t`**: The size of `uint32_t` is fixed at 32 bits (4 bytes).

5. **`uint64_t`**: The size of `uint64_t` is fixed at 64 bits (8 bytes).

These fixed-width integer types, like `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, and `uint64_t`, are part of the `<cstdint>` header in C++. They are provided to ensure consistent integer sizes across different platforms.

Keep in mind that these sizes are general conventions, and you should always check the documentation or specific headers of your compiler or platform for the most accurate and up-to-date information. To query the size of a type on your system, you can use the `sizeof` operator in C or C++. For example:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]
