Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the changes made to the constructor and the use of `constexpr`.

### Constructor Changes:

In your original code, the `UltrasonicSensor` class had a member variable `_id` of type `String`. This type is dynamic and can lead to memory fragmentation in resource-constrained environments. To address this, I suggested using a fixed-size character array (`char[]`) for the `_id` member variable. This change can improve memory efficiency and avoid potential issues related to dynamic memory allocation.

Here's a breakdown of the changes made to the constructor:

1. **Member Variable Type Change:**
    [CODE_BLOCK_0]

   I changed the type of `_id` from `String` to `char[3]`. This assumes that your sensor IDs are two characters long, and I added one extra character for the null terminator.

2. **Constructor Initialization:**
    [CODE_BLOCK_1]

   In the modified constructor, I use `strncpy` to copy the characters from the provided `id` string to the `_id` array. The `sizeof(_id) - 1` ensures that we don't exceed the size of the array, and I manually add the null terminator at the end to ensure the string is properly terminated.

### `constexpr`:

`constexpr` is a keyword in C++ that declares a variable, function, or expression as a constant that can be evaluated at compile time. It allows you to perform computations and use values that are known at compile time rather than runtime, which can lead to better optimization by the compiler.

In the context of the suggested changes, I introduced `constexpr` for defining constants. Constants declared with `constexpr` are evaluated at compile time, and the results are substituted directly into the code. This can lead to more efficient code execution.

Here's an example of using `constexpr` for constants:

[CODE_BLOCK_2]

The use of `constexpr` can help make your code more readable, avoid magic numbers, and potentially improve performance by allowing the compiler to perform optimizations based on the known constant values at compile time.
