The choice between `constexpr` and `const` for defining constants depends on your specific use case and requirements. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

1. **`constexpr int PulseInTimeoutMicros = 24000;`**:

   - **Pros:**
     - Evaluated at compile-time, allowing for potential optimizations.
     - Can be used in contexts requiring constant expressions, such as array sizes or template arguments.

   - **Cons:**
     - Limited to integral types (integers, characters, enumerations).

2. **`constexpr uint16_t PulseInTimeoutMicros = 24000;`**:

   - **Pros:**
     - Same benefits as `constexpr int`.
     - Explicitly specifies the type as `uint16_t`.

   - **Cons:**
     - Requires C++11 or later.

3. **`const uint16_t PulseInTimeoutMicros = 24000;`**:

   - **Pros:**
     - Simplicity and ease of use.
     - Compatible with earlier C++ standards.

   - **Cons:**
     - Not guaranteed to be evaluated at compile-time (depends on the compiler and context).

### Recommendations:

- If your constant value is known at compile-time and you can use C++11 or later, prefer `constexpr` as it allows for better optimizations and is more versatile.

- If you need to explicitly specify the type and still want compile-time evaluation, use `constexpr` with the desired type (`constexpr uint16_t`).

- If your constant doesn't need to be evaluated at compile-time, or if you are constrained to earlier C++ standards, use `const`.

Here's an example using `constexpr uint16_t`:

Choose the option that best fits your specific needs while considering readability, compatibility, and potential compiler optimizations.
