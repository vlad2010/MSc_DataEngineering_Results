It seems like you're encountering an issue related to non-static member references in your code. Without seeing the specific part of your code that is causing the error, it's a bit challenging to pinpoint the exact problem. However, I'll provide some general guidance on how to handle non-static member references in C++.

When you see the error "a non-static member reference must be relative to a specific object," it typically means that you are trying to access a non-static member of a class without an instance of that class. Here are a few common scenarios where this error might occur:

1. **Accessing a non-static member without an object:**
   [CODE_BLOCK_0]

   To fix this, you need to create an instance of the class and access the member through that instance:

   [CODE_BLOCK_1]

2. **Trying to use a non-static member in a static context:**
   If you are trying to use a non-static member within a static member function or a static context, you'll encounter this error.

   [CODE_BLOCK_2]

   To fix this, either make the member static or use it within a non-static context.

Please provide the specific code snippet or context where you're encountering this error if you need more targeted assistance.
