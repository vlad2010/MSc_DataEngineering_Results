The error in your SVG file is due to the incorrect placement of the `<path>` element within the `<marker>` definition. The `<path>` element should be a child element of the `<marker>` tag, not a sibling. Here's the corrected version:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this corrected version, I moved the `<path>` element inside the `<marker>` tag as its child. Now, the SVG file should be correctly formatted without errors.
