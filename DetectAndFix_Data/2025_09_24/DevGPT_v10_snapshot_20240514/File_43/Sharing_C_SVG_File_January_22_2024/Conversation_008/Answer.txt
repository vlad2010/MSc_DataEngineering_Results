Certainly! Let's add a function to create the marker definition and another function to draw a line with the specified attributes.

### svg_writer.h

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

### svg_writer.cpp

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

### main.cpp

[CODE_BLOCK_2]

Now, you have functions to create a marker definition (`writeMarker`) and to draw a line with the specified attributes (`writeLine`). These functions can be easily reused in your code.
