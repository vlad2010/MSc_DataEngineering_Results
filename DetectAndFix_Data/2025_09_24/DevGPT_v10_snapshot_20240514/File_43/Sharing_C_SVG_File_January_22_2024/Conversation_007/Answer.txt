Certainly! Let's add a function to create a circle in the SVG file.

### svg_writer.h

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

### svg_writer.cpp

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

### main.cpp

[CODE_BLOCK_2]

Now, you have a `writeCircle` function that adds a circle to the SVG file with specified parameters. You can call this function in your `main.cpp` or any other part of your code as needed.
