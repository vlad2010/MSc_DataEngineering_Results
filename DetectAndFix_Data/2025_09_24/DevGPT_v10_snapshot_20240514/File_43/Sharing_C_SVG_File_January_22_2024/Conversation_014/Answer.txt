The error in your `draw_vector` function is likely related to the usage of the `Point2D` class. If the `Point2D` class is not defined or if there are issues with its implementation, it might cause compilation errors. Additionally, ensure that the necessary includes and declarations are in place.

Here's an example of how your `draw_vector` function could be structured, assuming a hypothetical `Point2D` class:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This assumes that you have a `Point2D` class defined with appropriate members. Adjust the implementation based on your actual `Point2D` class or structure. If you provide more details or the definition of the `Point2D` class, I can offer more specific assistance.
