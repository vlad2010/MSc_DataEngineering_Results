I apologize for any confusion. It seems there might be an issue with the file-writing process. Let's make sure the file is being written correctly. I'll provide you with an updated version of the code, which includes proper handling of file writing.

### svg_writer.h

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

### svg_writer.cpp

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

### main.cpp

[CODE_BLOCK_2]

This structure separates the SVG writing logic into a `SVGWriter` class, making it more modular and easier to manage. The file is now closed automatically when the `SVGWriter` instance goes out of scope, avoiding potential issues with the file not being written completely.
