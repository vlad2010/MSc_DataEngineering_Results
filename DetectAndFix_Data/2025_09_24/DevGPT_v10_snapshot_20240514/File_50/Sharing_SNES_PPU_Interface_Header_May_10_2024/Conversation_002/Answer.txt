Certainly! Here's a C++ header file with declarations for functions to interact with each register of the SNES PPU. This version of the header includes a member function for each PPU register but does not include their implementations. The actual implementations would typically be provided in a corresponding `.cpp` file.

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This header file serves as an interface to the SNES's Picture Processing Unit (PPU), covering all the control and data registers. Each function is designed to abstract the details of the hardware interaction, providing a clear and concise API for manipulating the PPU's settings. Implementations of these functions should handle
