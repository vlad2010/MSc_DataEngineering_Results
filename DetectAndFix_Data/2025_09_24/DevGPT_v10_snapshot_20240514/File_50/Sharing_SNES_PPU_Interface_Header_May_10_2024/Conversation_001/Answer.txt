Here's a C++ header file that provides an interface to the SNES PPU, including all PPU registers. The header file defines a class to encapsulate the PPU and provides member functions to read and write to the registers.

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

### Usage Example

Here's a simple usage example:

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

This header file provides functions to access the PPU registers in a way that simplifies their manipulation and helps reduce errors associated with manually managing the registers.
