I apologize for the oversight. If you want the abilities to fire once every `cooldown` seconds as specified, you can adjust the code to handle the cooldown correctly. Here's the modified code:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this version of the code, abilities will use the correct cooldown and fire only once every `cooldown` seconds as specified.
