I apologize for the oversight. Here's the code with the updated `canDealDamage` and `updateActivity` functions, which use the requested comparisons:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This code uses the specified comparisons in `canDealDamage` and `updateActivity` for all abilities. Abilities are sorted by priority, and the iteration follows the order from highest to lowest priority.
0;
}
```
