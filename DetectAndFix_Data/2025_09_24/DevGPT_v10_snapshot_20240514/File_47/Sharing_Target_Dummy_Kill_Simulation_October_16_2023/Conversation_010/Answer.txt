I apologize for the oversight. If you want to remove the sleep entirely and control the tick rate manually, you can update the code as follows:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this code, the sleep has been removed, and the tick rate is controlled manually using the `ticksPerSecond` variable. The `abilityCooldown` is in terms of seconds.
