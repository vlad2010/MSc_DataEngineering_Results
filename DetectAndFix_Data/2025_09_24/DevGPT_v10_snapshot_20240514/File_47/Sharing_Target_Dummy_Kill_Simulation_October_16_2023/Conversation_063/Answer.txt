You're correct; my previous suggestion might not be suitable if you need to preserve the functionality of abilities that genuinely deal damage over time. 

Creating an ability like `DamageOverTimeAbility(3.0, 0, 0, priority)` with zero `cooldownSeconds` and zero `durationSeconds` is a good approach. This ability will act as a one-time damage ability that doesn't have any cooldown or duration, making it suitable for instant damage abilities. It won't interfere with other abilities that genuinely do damage over time.

Here's how you can use it within the game loop:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This way, you can have both abilities that do damage over time and abilities that deal instant damage, coexisting within the same framework.
