I apologize for the previous oversight. If you want to remove the sleep from the loop entirely and control the tick rate manually, you can update the code as follows:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this code, I've removed the sleep from the loop, and you can manually control the tick rate by adjusting the `ticksPerSecond` variable and the tick duration based on that rate. This should meet your requirement of not introducing sleep in the loop.
