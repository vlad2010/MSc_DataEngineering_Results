You're absolutely correct. I apologize for the oversight. Here's the corrected constructor:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Thank you for pointing that out, and I appreciate your understanding.
Seconds = static_cast<double>(ticks - 1) / ticksPerSecond;
    std::cout << "Target dummy killed in " << totalElapsedTimeSeconds << " seconds." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code now includes the individual cooldown and shared cooldown mechanism, cool ability names, and prints out health, ability names, current tick, and time as requested.
