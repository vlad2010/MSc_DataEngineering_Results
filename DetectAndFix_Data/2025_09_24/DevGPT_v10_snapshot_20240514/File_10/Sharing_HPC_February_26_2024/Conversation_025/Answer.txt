To optimize your initial matrix multiplication code using processes for concurrency, we'll integrate `fork()`, `wait()`, and shared memory (`shmget()`, `shmat()`, `shmdt()`, and `shmctl()`) into your program. This approach allows the matrix multiplication workload to be distributed across multiple processes, potentially improving performance on multicore systems.

The updated code will:

1. Use shared memory segments for matrices A, B, and C to ensure that child processes can access and modify the content of these matrices.
2. Fork a new process for each row of the result matrix C, where each child process will perform the multiplication for one row of A by matrix B.
3. Use `wait()` in the parent process to ensure all child processes complete their computation before proceeding to print the results and free allocated resources.

Here's how you can implement these changes:

This code demonstrates a basic approach to parallelizing matrix multiplication using processes in C. It includes creating shared memory segments for matrices A, B, and C, forking a new process for each row in the result matrix, and using `wait
