To modularize your matrix multiplication code, we can encapsulate different parts of the program into functions. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability. Here's how you can structure the program:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: Create functions for allocating and initializing matrices.
2. **Matrix Multiplication**: Implement the multiplication logic in a separate function.
3. **Memory Cleanup**: Use a function to free the allocated memory for matrices.
4. **Main Workflow**: The `main` function will orchestrate the program flow by calling these functions.

Here's the modularized version of your code:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

### Explanation:

- **`initializeAndFillMatrix`**: This function initializes a matrix of size `N x N` and optionally fills it with random numbers. The `isZero` parameter determines whether the matrix should be filled with zeros or random numbers.
- **`multiplyMatrices`**: Performs the actual matrix multiplication, storing the result in matrix `C`.
- **`freeMatrix`**: Frees the memory allocated for a matrix.
- **`printMatrix`**: Prints the contents of a matrix, useful for debugging or when the `-v` or `--verbose` flag is used.
- **`main`**: Orchestrates the workflow by calling these functions in sequence.

This modularized approach makes the code more organized and easier to understand and modify. If you want to control the printing of matrices based on a `-v` or `--verbose` flag, you could add additional logic in `main` to check for these flags and conditionally call `printMatrix` for each matrix.
