Can you help me correct this:

```python
class AppState:
    """
    Your global application state, that will be edited during the execution.

    Note about AppState:
    Inside ImGui demo code, you will often see static variables, such as in this example
        static int value = 10;
        bool changed = ImGui::SliderInt("Value", &value, 0, 10);  // edit this variable between 0 and 10
    In this example, `value` is a static variable whose state is preserved:
    it merely acts as a global variable, whose scope is limited to this function.
    Global variables should be avoided, and storing the Application State like this is preferable in production code.
    """

    plot_data: List[float] = [0.15, 0.30, 0.2, 0.05]
    markdown_input: str = "*Welcome to the interactive markdown demo!* Try writing some markdown content here."
    show_assets_info: bool = False
    show_markdown_info: bool = False
    show_implot_info: bool = False
```

python says "plot_data is mutable, use default_factory"
