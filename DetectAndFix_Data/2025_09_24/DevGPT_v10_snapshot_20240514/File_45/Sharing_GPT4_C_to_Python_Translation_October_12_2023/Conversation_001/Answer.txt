Yes, I understand the principle!

Here's a summary of the key differences between the C++ and Python code:

1. **Naming Convention**: As mentioned, CamelCase in C++ is translated to snake_case in Python, except for class names.

2. **Parameter Passing & Return Values**: In C++, values are passed by reference (using pointers or references) and are modified in place. In Python, values are returned as tuples, and the caller is responsible for unpacking the tuple and updating the variable if needed.

3. **Libraries & Dependencies**: In C++, libraries are included using `#include`, while in Python they are imported using the `import` statement.

4. **Data Types**: There's a difference in how arrays are handled. In C++, the `std::vector` type is used, whereas in Python, `numpy` arrays are preferred.

5. **Looping and Mathematical Operations**: While C++ uses loops for some operations, Python can often leverage vectorized operations via `numpy` for efficiency.

6. **Random Number Generation**: C++ uses `rand()` while Python uses the `random` module.

7. **Main Execution**: C++ requires an explicit `main()` function, while Python can execute directly from top-level script commands.

The way GUI elements are created and handled in both languages reflects the paradigms and strengths of each language. C++ leans more on pointers and references to manipulate data, while Python leverages its dynamic typing and flexible function return mechanisms.

With these principles in mind, I can assist with further translations between C++ and Python as needed.
