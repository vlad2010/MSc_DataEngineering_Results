Alright, let's translate the provided C++ code into Python using the guidelines and library interfaces you provided:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]python
            def explain(thing):
                return "It's just a " + thing + ". Nothing fancy!"
            [CODE_BLOCK_1]

Changes made:

1. **String Representation**: I replaced the C++ raw string literal (`R"(...)"`) with Python's triple-quoted string (`"""..."""`).

2. **Method Names and Argument Styles**: The method names and their arguments have been changed to fit the Pythonic version you provided earlier (e.g., `RenderUnindented` to `render_unindented`).

3. **String Handling**: I replaced the C++ `strcpy` function with a simple assignment in Python.

4. **Interacting with AppState**: I accessed `AppState`'s attributes with the dot notation and updated them directly since Python is not pass-by-reference like C++.

5. **Sizeof**: In C++, `sizeof` gives the size of an object or datatype. In Python, you can directly use the size of the buffer, which in the previous example was `4000`.

This translation should closely match the functionality of the original C++ code in Python, using the interfaces you provided from `imgui_bundle`.
