Absolutely! Let's start the translation of your C++ code into Python, leveraging Dear PyGui (or a similar library) for GUI rendering and other equivalent libraries for markdown rendering and plotting. Here's a rough translation:

Python's translation of your code will be somewhat different because of the nature of the language and the libraries we use. We'll use `dearpygui` for the GUI part and `matplotlib` for plotting. 

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Please note:

1. This translation is quite high-level. The exact implementation will require more detail, especially when dealing with interactivity, plotting, and markdown rendering.
2. The structure may need changes based on the exact Python libraries you intend to use.
3. For markdown rendering in Python, there are libraries like `Markdown` that can be used, but integrating it into the GUI may require additional work.
4. Python doesn't have a direct equivalent to C++ structs, so we use classes instead.

This should give you a rough idea and a starting point. Adjustments will be needed based on the specific requirements and the Python libraries' capabilities.
