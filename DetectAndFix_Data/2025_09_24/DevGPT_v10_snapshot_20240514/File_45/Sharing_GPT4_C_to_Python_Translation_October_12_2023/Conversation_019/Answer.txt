Sure! Translating the given code to Python and adapting it to your ImGuiBundle library:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]python
            def explain(thing):
                return "It's just a " + thing + ". Nothing fancy!"
            [CODE_BLOCK_1]

Please note:

1. I've removed the need to handle C-style string manipulation with functions like `strcpy` since Python strings are dynamic.
2. I assumed the function `CodeUtils::UnindentMarkdown` corresponds to the Python function `demo_utils.unindent_markdown`.
3. The C++ version used the size of the buffer as the third argument to `InputTextMultiline`. Since you mentioned that it's not necessary in your library for Python, I've omitted it.

Let me know if this matches your expectations!
