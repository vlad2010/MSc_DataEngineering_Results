Let's translate the `DemoPlot` function from C++ to Python, keeping the original comments and structure:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

**Points to Note**:

1. Changed function signature to Python's def format.
2. Replaced C++ array with Python's list for `data_labels`.
3. Used `np.array` to work with arrays in a manner similar to C++ (notably for `imgui.drag_float4`).
4. Replaced all C++ specific function calls with their corresponding Pythonic versions.
5. Made sure that comments are preserved.
6. For the checkbox handling, I've followed the same structure as before, where the checkbox state and the actual data are unpacked from the function's return value.
