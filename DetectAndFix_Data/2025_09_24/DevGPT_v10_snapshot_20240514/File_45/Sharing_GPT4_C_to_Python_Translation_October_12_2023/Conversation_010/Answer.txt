To translate the C++ includes into Python imports for the ImGuiBundle library, we would generally use Python's `import` statement. Given the previous context you provided, the translation would look something like this:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Please note: 
- I added the `numpy` import because we're going to need it for the data handling.
- I made an assumption on the `demo_utils/api_demos` since it wasn't discussed previously, but if there's a specific module in your library for that, it should be imported accordingly.
- The exact module names might vary depending on how the ImGuiBundle library is structured in Python. The above is a direct translation based on the provided C++ includes. Adjustments might be necessary based on the actual Python module names in ImGuiBundle.
