Certainly! Here's a summary of the changes you made to the translated `demo_plot` function:

1. **Naming Convention**: Adopted the snake_case naming convention for variable names, in line with PEP8 style guidelines for Python. For example:
    - `appState` → `app_state`
    - `plotSize` → `plot_size`

2. **Enum Access**: Changed how the ImPlot axis flags are accessed:
    - `implot.ImPlotAxisFlags_NoDecorations` → `implot.AxisFlags_.no_decorations`

3. **Array Handling**: Directly passed the `app_state.plot_data` as a numpy array to the `implot.plot_pie_chart` function:
    - Instead of just `appState.plot_data`, it is now `np.array(app_state.plot_data)`.

4. **Formatting**: The overall formatting and structure of the function have been streamlined to ensure readability and consistency.

The changes ensure that the code is more idiomatic to Python, adhering to common naming conventions and practices in the Python community.
