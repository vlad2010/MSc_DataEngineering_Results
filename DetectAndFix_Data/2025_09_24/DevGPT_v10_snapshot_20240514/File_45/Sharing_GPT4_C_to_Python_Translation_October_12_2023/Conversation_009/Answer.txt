I apologize for the oversight. Yes, I do remember the guidelines and the examples you provided earlier. Let's summarize:

1. **Handling value changes with ImGui**:
   
   C++:
   [CODE_BLOCK_0]
   becomes Python:
   [CODE_BLOCK_1]

2. **Enums**:

   C++:
   [CODE_BLOCK_2]
   becomes Python:
   [CODE_BLOCK_3]

3. **Numeric buffers**: In Python, you mentioned using numpy arrays instead of C-style arrays. 

4. **Static variables**: In the ImGui demo code in C++, static variables are commonly used. You introduced a `static` decorator in Python to mimic this behavior. The static variables in a function are accessed as attributes of the function itself.

Given this understanding, let's attempt translating your C++ code into Python using your ImGuiBundle library.
