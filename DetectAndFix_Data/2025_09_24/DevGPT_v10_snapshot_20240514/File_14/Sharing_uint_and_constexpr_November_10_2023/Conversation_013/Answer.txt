Your code looks well-structured, and there are a few improvements you can consider for memory efficiency and safety. Here are some suggestions:

1. **String vs. char arrays**: Using `String` class can sometimes lead to memory fragmentation and is generally less memory-efficient than using character arrays (`char[]`). In your case, since the sensor IDs are fixed, you can use `char[]` instead of `String` for the `_id` member variable in the `UltrasonicSensor` class.

    This change can save memory and is generally safer, especially in embedded systems with limited resources.

2. **Deconstructor**: You have a commented-out deconstructor (`~UltrasonicSensor() { }`). If you're not doing anything specific in the deconstructor, it's not necessary to define it. The compiler-generated deconstructor should be sufficient.

3. **Use `constexpr`**: If the sizes of arrays are known at compile time, consider using `constexpr` for better optimization.

4. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Consider using named constants or enumerations for constants like `24000` in `pulseIn` or `3000` in the loop.

    [CODE_BLOCK_2]

These suggestions focus on improving memory efficiency, using safer constructs, and making the code more maintainable. Always make sure to test your code thoroughly after making such changes to ensure that it still behaves as expected.
