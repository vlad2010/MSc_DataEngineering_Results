Certainly, constraining the `const char* id` parameter to a fixed array size is a good idea for additional safety. This ensures that the function receives a pointer to a character array of a specified size, preventing potential buffer overflows or undefined behavior.

Here's an updated version of the constructor with a fixed array size for the `const char* id` parameter:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

With this modification, the `const char id[3]` parameter specifies that the function expects a pointer to a character array of size 3. This helps prevent the caller from passing an arbitrarily large string and ensures that the function works with the expected size of the ID.

Always consider the maximum expected size of the input when choosing the size of the array. In this case, it assumes that sensor IDs are two characters long, plus one for the null terminator. Adjust the size accordingly based on your specific requirements.
