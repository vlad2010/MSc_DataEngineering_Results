In C++, the `uint16_t` type is a fixed-width unsigned integer type that is 16 bits or 2 bytes in size. It's guaranteed to represent values in the range of 0 to 65535 (2^16 - 1). The `uint16_t` type is defined in the `<cstdint>` header, and it provides a consistent size across different platforms.

Here's an example of using `uint16_t`:

This code snippet shows how to declare a variable of type `uint16_t` and outputs the size of `uint16_t` in bytes. On most systems, the size of `uint16_t` will be 2 bytes.
