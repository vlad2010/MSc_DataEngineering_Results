Yes, using `const uint8_t` is absolutely valid and commonly used in C++ when you want to declare a constant 8-bit unsigned integer. The `const` qualifier indicates that the value of the variable cannot be changed after initialization.

Here's an example:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this example, `myConstUint8` is a constant variable of type `uint8_t`, and attempting to modify its value after initialization will result in a compilation error.

Using `const` is a good practice for creating constants in your code, as it helps make your intentions clear and can assist the compiler in optimizing your code. It's especially useful when working with fixed-width integer types like `uint8_t` to ensure that the value remains within the valid range and doesn't change accidentally.
