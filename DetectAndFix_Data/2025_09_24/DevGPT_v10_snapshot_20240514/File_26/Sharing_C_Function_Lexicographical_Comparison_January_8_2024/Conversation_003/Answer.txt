Certainly! Below is a C function that performs a merge operation on chunks of records from the input file and writes the sorted records to the output file:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This code assumes that the input file contains chunks of sorted records, each of size `chunkSize * SIZE`. The `merge` function reads chunks, sorts them, and writes the sorted records to the output file. The `compareRecords` function is used by `qsort` for record comparison during sorting. Note that you'll need to replace the placeholder comments with the actual file handling code according to your specific requirements.
