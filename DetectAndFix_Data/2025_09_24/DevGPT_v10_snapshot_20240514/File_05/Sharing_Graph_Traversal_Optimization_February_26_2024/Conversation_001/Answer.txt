Sure, I'll provide some insights and suggestions for simplifying and optimizing the code:

1. **Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This header is non-standard and considered bad practice. Instead, include only the necessary headers such as `<unordered_map>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`, and `<fstream>`.

2. **Use `emplace_back` Instead of `push_back`**: When adding elements to vectors, consider using `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` for potential performance benefits, especially if constructing objects.

3. **Simplify File Input Handling**: Instead of looping until a valid file is provided, consider providing a more user-friendly prompt and handling file opening errors more gracefully.

4. **Improve Graph Construction**: You can simplify the graph construction process using modern C++ features like `emplace_back` to directly construct nodes and edges without using temporary variables like `str` and `ss`.

5. **Refactor Depth-First Search (DFS) Function**: The DFS function is quite complex. Consider refactoring it into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.

6. **Use Standard Naming Conventions**: Follow standard naming conventions for functions and variables to enhance code readability and consistency.

7. **Avoid Manual Memory Management**: Use smart pointers or standard containers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::vector` instead of manual memory management with `new` and `delete`.

Here's a refactored version of the code incorporating some of these suggestions:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This refactored code should be more readable, maintainable, and efficient. It follows modern C++ best practices and standard naming conventions. However, further optimizations and improvements may still be possible depending on specific requirements and constraints.
