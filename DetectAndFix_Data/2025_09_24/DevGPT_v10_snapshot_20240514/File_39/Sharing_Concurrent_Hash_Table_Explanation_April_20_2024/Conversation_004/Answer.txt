You're correct; my apologies for the oversight. Since this implementation relies on linked lists for collision resolution rather than separate chaining with arrays, the concept of a fixed hash table size isn't applicable. Each node in the linked list corresponds to a key-value pair, and collisions are resolved by chaining nodes together.

Let's revise the implementation to remove the fixed hash table size and use a purely linked list-based approach for storing key-value pairs:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This revised implementation uses a purely linked list-based approach for storing key-value pairs. Each node in the linked list represents a record, and collisions are resolved by chaining nodes together within the list.
