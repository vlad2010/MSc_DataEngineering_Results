I've made the following changes:

1. Moved the `jenkins_one_at_a_time_hash` function to the top of the file to ensure it's defined before being used.
2. Initialized the hash table lock using `pthread_create` as requested.
3. Modified the `insert` function to ensure that the `name` string is correctly copied into the `hashRecord`.
4. Integrated the provided code with the hash table implementation.
