Certainly! Below is a basic implementation of the Concurrent Hash Table and its linked list operations in the `hashdb.c` file:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Make sure to include `pthread.h` for pthread functions, and `hashdb.h` for the hashRecord structure definition. This implementation provides basic functionality for inserting, deleting, searching, and printing records in the concurrent hash table. It uses a simple linked list collision resolution strategy.
