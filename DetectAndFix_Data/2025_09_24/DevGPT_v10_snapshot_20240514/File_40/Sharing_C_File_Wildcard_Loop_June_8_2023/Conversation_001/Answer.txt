Certainly! Here's an example of how you can use standard libraries in C to find files matching a wildcard search string and loop through their contents:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this code, we include the necessary standard libraries: `stdio.h` for file operations, `stdlib.h` for memory management, `dirent.h` for directory operations, `string.h` for string operations, and `glob.h` for wildcard matching.

The `processFile` function takes a filename as a parameter and opens the file for reading. It then reads the file line by line and processes each line. In this example, we simply print each line, but you can modify this function to suit your needs.

The `searchFiles` function takes a search pattern as a parameter and uses the `glob` function to find files matching the pattern. It then loops through the matched file paths and calls the `processFile` function for each file.

In the `main` function, we define a search pattern (e.g., `*.txt`) and call the `searchFiles` function to perform the search and processing of files.

Note: This code assumes that you are working on a POSIX-compliant system (e.g., Linux). If you're working on a different platform, some functions or libraries may have different implementations or may not be available.
