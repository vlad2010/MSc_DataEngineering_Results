Write a c function with the following signature "void merge(int input_FileDesc, int chunkSize, int bWay, int output_FileDesc )". The members "input_FileDesc" and "output_FileDesc" refer to file descriptors of open files. The "input_FileDesc" file is comprised of a number of chunks. Each chunk is comprised of a number of "blocks" denoted by the member "chunkSize". Each blocks contains "SIZE" number of records. The records in each chunk are sorted in respect to each other, but not sorted between chunks. The function must write to the "output_FileDesc" file the records of the other file, in ascending order by merging the records in a way similar to the mergesort sorting algorithm. The "bWay" member denotes the number of chunks that can be merged in each pass.
