Certainly! Here's an example of how you can use the Graphviz-C API in C++ to generate a graph for FSM (Finite State Machine) state transitions:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this example, we create a directed graph representing a Finite State Machine with three states: State1, State2, and State3. We create edges to represent state transitions, and we set labels for the edges to represent the triggering events.

The `agnode` function is used to create nodes in the graph, and `agedge` is used to create directed edges between nodes. The `agsafeset` function is used to set attributes for the edges, in this case, the label attribute representing the events.

After creating the graph and setting the attributes, we save the graph to a DOT file named "fsm.dot" using the `agwrite` function. Finally, we clean up the resources by calling `agclose` to close the graph.

You can then use the Graphviz tools (e.g., the `dot` command) to render the DOT file to a desired format such as PNG, SVG, or PDF. For example, you can use the following command to generate a PNG image from the DOT file:

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

This will create a PNG image (`fsm.png`) representing the FSM state transitions graph.
