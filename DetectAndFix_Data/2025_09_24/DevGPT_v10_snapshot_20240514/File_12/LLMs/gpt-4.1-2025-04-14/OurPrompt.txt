I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question. You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications. Please write code where detected security issue is fixed, please write all code in one code fragment.
(```cpp
#include <graphviz/cgraph.h>

int main() {
  // Create a new directed graph
  Agraph_t* graph = agopen("FSM", Agdirected, nullptr);

  // Create nodes for states
  Agnode_t* state1 = agnode(graph, "State1", true);
  Agnode_t* state2 = agnode(graph, "State2", true);
  Agnode_t* state3 = agnode(graph, "State3", true);

  // Create edges for state transitions
  Agedge_t* transition1 = agedge(graph, state1, state2, nullptr, true);
  Agedge_t* transition2 = agedge(graph, state2, state3, nullptr, true);
  Agedge_t* transition3 = agedge(graph, state3, state1, nullptr, true);

  // Set attributes for edges
  agsafeset(transition1, "label", "Event1", "");
  agsafeset(transition2, "label", "Event2", "");
  agsafeset(transition3, "label", "Event3", "");

  // Save the graph to a DOT file
  FILE* file = fopen("fsm.dot", "w");
  agwrite(graph, file);
  fclose(file);

  // Cleanup
  agclose(graph);
  
  return 0;
}
