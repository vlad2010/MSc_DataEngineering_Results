Analysis (senior security review)

Key security and robustness issues found:

- CWE-125: Out-of-bounds read. In wordLadder, the code indexes strcomp[i] while iterating i up to word.length() without verifying strcomp has the same length. If dictionary contains words of different lengths, this reads past the end of strcomp.
- CWE-788: Access of memory location after end of buffer. After the search loop, the program calls ladder.back() without ensuring ladder is non-empty. If the algorithm pops the only element, calling back() on an empty vector is undefined behavior (can crash).
- CWE-252/CWE-703: Unchecked return values / improper check for exceptional conditions. The program doesn’t verify that the dictionary file was successfully opened and uses the anti-pattern while(!inFile.eof()) to read, which can consume invalid input and push an extra empty or partial token. It also doesn’t validate std::cin >> word >> target succeeded.
- CWE-20: Improper input validation. There’s no validation that start and target have the same non-zero length before processing. This also contributes to the out-of-bounds read.
- CWE-674/CWE-400: Uncontrolled recursion / potential DoS. The recursive DFS can blow the stack on large dictionaries or deep search paths, and with no visited set it can revisit states, exacerbating resource consumption. This is a denial-of-service vector.
- General robustness: Global mutable state (deadEnds) is unused and could become a hazard in future multi-threaded contexts; remove it.

Fixes applied:

- Validate file open, and read safely using while (inFile >> token) pattern.
- Validate user input success and that start/target lengths are equal and non-zero.
- Replace recursive DFS with an iterative BFS using a queue and a visited set to eliminate recursion (mitigating stack exhaustion) and to ensure termination.
- Guard all indexing with length checks; compute Hamming distance safely.
- Never call vector::back() unless ladder is known non-empty.
- Use size_t for indices; handle potential large inputs more safely.

What was fixed and why (mapping to CWEs):

- CWE-125 (Out-of-Bounds Read): Removed direct indexing into strings of potentially different lengths. We now compute Hamming distance only when lengths match; we filter dictionary by length and guard in hammingDistance.
- CWE-788 (Access after end of buffer): Removed unsafe ladder.back() on possibly empty vector. We only access the ladder after verifying non-empty, and return early when no solution exists.
- CWE-252/CWE-703 (Unchecked return values / improper checks): We verify file open success and use while (inFile >> token) to read. We also check that std::cin >> start >> target succeeds and that no I/O errors occurred.
- CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): We ensure start/target are non-empty and have equal lengths before processing.
- CWE-674/CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Recursion / DoS): Replaced recursive DFS with iterative BFS using a queue and a visited set to ensure termination and prevent stack exhaustion.
- Removed unused global mutable state to avoid latent hazards and improve maintainability.

This version is safer, more robust, and deterministically terminates while preventing out-of-bounds access.
