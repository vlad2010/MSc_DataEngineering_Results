Starting with 200 and using a common ratio of 2, the geometric progression for 10 scales would be as follows:

1. 200 (initial value)
2. 400 (200 * 2)
3. 800 (400 * 2)
4. 1600 (800 * 2)
5. 3200 (1600 * 2)
6. 6400 (3200 * 2)
7. 12800 (6400 * 2)
8. 25600 (12800 * 2)
9. 51200 (25600 * 2)
10. 102400 (51200 * 2)

This sequence starts at 200 and doubles each term, reaching 102400 by the 10th term. The progression remains consistent with the doubling pattern, providing a clear demonstration of exponential growth suitable for performance analysis across a broad range of scales.
