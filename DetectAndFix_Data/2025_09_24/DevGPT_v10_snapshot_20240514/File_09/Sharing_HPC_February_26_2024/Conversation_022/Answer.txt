Here's the translated shell script into English with the specified updates:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

And here's the corresponding `README.md` documentation:

[CODE_BLOCK_1]bash
gcc matrix_multiplication_sequential.c -o matrix_multiplication_sequential
[CODE_BLOCK_2]bash
./matrix_multiplication_sequential N
[CODE_BLOCK_3]bash
chmod +x run_tests.sh matrix_multiplication_sequential
[CODE_BLOCK_4]bash
./run_tests.sh
[CODE_BLOCK_5]

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive guide for compiling, running, and analyzing the performance of the sequential matrix multiplication program, specifically designed to explore the effects of doubling the matrix size in each iteration.
