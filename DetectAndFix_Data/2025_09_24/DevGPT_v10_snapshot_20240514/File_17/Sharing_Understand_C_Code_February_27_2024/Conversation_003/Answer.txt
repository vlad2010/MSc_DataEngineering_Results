Certainly! Here's a refactored version of the `_88MPH` function that is more concise and simplified:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this version, I've made the following changes:

1. Added const references for unordered_maps parameters to avoid unnecessary copying.
2. Combined the initial battery check and charging station existence check.
3. Removed redundant battery charge check (battery charge is guaranteed to be between 0 and 75.5 after adding charge from the current station).
4. Simplified the condition for pushing the starting location onto the path.
5. Removed unnecessary variable `stationName`.
6. Reduced variable scope where possible.
7. Simplified comments for clarity.
