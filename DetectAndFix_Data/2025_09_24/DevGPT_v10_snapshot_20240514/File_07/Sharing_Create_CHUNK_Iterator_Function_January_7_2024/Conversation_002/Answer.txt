Certainly! You can implement the `CHUNK_GetNext` function as follows:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This `CHUNK_GetNext` function retrieves the next CHUNK in the sequence based on the provided `CHUNK_Iterator`. It updates the `chunk` structure with information about the current CHUNK and increments the iterator to point to the next CHUNK. The function returns `-1` if there are no more CHUNKs to retrieve.
