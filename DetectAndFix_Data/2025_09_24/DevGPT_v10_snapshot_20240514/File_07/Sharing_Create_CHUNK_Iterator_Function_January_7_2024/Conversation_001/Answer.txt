To create a `CHUNK_Iterator` for efficient traversal of chunks within a file, you can implement the `CHUNK_CreateIterator` function as follows:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This `CHUNK_CreateIterator` function initializes a `CHUNK_Iterator` with the provided `fileDesc`, starts the iteration from block 1, sets the initial value for `lastBlocksID` (update it based on your requirements), and sets the `blocksInChunk` parameter. You can adjust the initialization values according to your specific needs.
