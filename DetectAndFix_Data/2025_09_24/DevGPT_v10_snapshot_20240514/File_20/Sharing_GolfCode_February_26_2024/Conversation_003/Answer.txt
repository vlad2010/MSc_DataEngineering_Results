Yes, the code can definitely be improved for clarity, readability, and maintainability. The original code sacrifices readability for brevity, which makes it difficult to understand its purpose and logic at first glance. Here's how it could be improved:

1. **Use Meaningful Variable Names**: Replace single-letter variable names (`t`, `_`, `a`) with more descriptive names that indicate their purpose.

2. **Use Standard Function Declarations**: Instead of relying on old-style function declarations, use modern C function declarations with explicit types.

3. **Split Complex Expressions**: Break down complex expressions and conditional statements into smaller, more manageable parts to improve readability.

4. **Add Comments**: Provide clear comments explaining the purpose and logic of each section of code.

5. **Format Code Properly**: Use consistent indentation and spacing to make the code easier to read.

6. **Remove Obfuscation**: Simplify the code to make it easier to understand without sacrificing functionality.

Here's an example of how the code could be improved with these principles:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this improved version, the code is more readable, with meaningful variable and function names, clear comments, and a more structured approach to processing characters.
