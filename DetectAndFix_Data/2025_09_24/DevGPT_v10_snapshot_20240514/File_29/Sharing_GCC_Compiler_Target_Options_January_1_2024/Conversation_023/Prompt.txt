Your test is kind of slow. It takes a second to run. You forgot to take out the sleep() statement that you were sloppily using earlier to address the race condition the improper way. It's ok. I just took that out for you, and your program worked fine. That's all for now. Thank you for helping me write a test. You'll be able to read about your efforts in the future in our lofty publication.
