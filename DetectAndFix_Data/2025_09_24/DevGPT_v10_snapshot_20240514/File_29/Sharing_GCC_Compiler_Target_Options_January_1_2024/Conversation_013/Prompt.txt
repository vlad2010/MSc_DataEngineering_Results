Good. Now all your `EXIT_FAILURE` repeats aren't useful. Give each one a unique non-zero integer to help developers with troubleshooting. Another thing to do, is right after calling sigaction() the first time, do the sanity check there to ask the kernel the SIGINT config and verify that the kernel says it is in fact set to your callback at that time. That'll help us prove that it's actually the signal itself that resets it.
