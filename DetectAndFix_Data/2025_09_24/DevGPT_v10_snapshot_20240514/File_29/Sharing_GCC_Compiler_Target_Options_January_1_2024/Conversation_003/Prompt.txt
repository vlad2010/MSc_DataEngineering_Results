That's enough. Thank you. Now I need you to create a file named sa_resethand_test.c and implement a program that'll be run by an autoconf script which verifies the POSIX conformance of the host operating system's implementation. Users need to know that the kernel developers and c library authors haven't made mistakes, since it's useful for unit testing too. No print() statements are needed. It's sufficient to simply report errors using exit() with a non-zero code.
