The execution of the `sa_resethand_test` program was interrupted because it did not complete within the allocated time limit of 60 seconds. This behavior is expected for this program, as it is designed to wait indefinitely for a `SIGINT` signal (usually generated by pressing `Ctrl+C`).

The program compiled successfully without any errors, indicating that the syntax and environment are correct for compilation. However, since the program's logic is to wait for a signal and it does not terminate on its own, it did not complete execution within the time frame of this environment.

To properly test the program, it would need to be run in an environment where it can receive a `SIGINT` signal and respond accordingly.
