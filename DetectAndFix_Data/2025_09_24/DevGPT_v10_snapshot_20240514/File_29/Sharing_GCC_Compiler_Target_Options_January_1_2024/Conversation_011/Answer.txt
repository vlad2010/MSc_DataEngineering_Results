The corrected `sa_resethand_test` program was successfully compiled and executed in my environment. Here are the details:

- **Compilation Output**: There were no errors or warnings during the compilation.
- **Execution Output**: The program did not produce any standard output or error messages.
- **Exit Code**: The program exited with an exit code of `0`.

This result indicates that the program successfully tested the `SA_RESETHAND` functionality. The signal handler was invoked by the `SIGINT` signal sent by the child process, and after handling the signal, the program verified that the signal action for `SIGINT` was indeed reset to the default (`SIG_DFL`). The exit code `0` signifies that all parts of the test passed as expected, confirming the correct behavior of the `SA_RESETHAND` flag in this environment.
