The `sa_resethand_test.c` file has been updated with additional checks after the `pause()` call. The updated program now includes:

1. A check to confirm that the signal handler callback function was invoked.
2. A call to `sigaction()` after the signal is received to verify that the disposition of `SIGINT` was automatically reverted to `SIG_DFL` (the default action) by the kernel.

This ensures a more thorough test of the `SA_RESETHAND` flag's functionality. You can download the updated file using the following link:
