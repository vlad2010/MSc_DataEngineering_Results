Certainly! Here is the corrected and final version of the `sa_resethand_test.c` program:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This program creates a child process that sends a `SIGINT` signal to the parent process after a brief pause. The parent process sets up a signal handler for `SIGINT` with the `SA_RESETHAND` flag, which should reset the handler to the default action after the signal is handled once. The program checks if the signal handler was invoked and then verifies that the signal action for `SIGINT` has been reset to the default. If any of these checks fail, the program exits with a failure code.
