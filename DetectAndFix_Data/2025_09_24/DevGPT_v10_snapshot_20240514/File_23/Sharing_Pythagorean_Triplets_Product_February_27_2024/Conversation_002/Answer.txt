Certainly! We can refactor the code to make it more concise and easier to understand by breaking it down into smaller, more modular functions and using clearer variable names. Here's a revised version of the program:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this version:

- I've created a separate function `isPythagorean` to check if three numbers form a Pythagorean triplet.
- Another function `findPythagoreanProduct` is used to find the product of the Pythagorean triplet given the sum of its sides.
- I've used clearer variable names and comments to enhance readability.
- The main function now simply takes user input, calls the `findPythagoreanProduct` function, and prints the result.
