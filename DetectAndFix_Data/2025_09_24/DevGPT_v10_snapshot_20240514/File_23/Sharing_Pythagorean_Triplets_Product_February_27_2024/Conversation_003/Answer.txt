Of course! Here's the code with added comments to explain the mathematical concepts used:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

I've added comments to explain Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triplets (`a = m^2 - n^2, b = 2mn, c = m^2 + n^2`) and the Pythagorean theorem (`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`). These comments should help clarify the mathematical concepts used in the code.
