The race condition fixed `sa_resethand_test` program was successfully compiled and executed in my environment, exiting with an exit code of `0`. This indicates that all the checks passed, including the synchronization between the parent and child processes using a pipe to avoid the race condition.

Here's the race condition fixed code for you to try:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This program uses a pipe to ensure that the parent process is ready and waiting for the signal before the child sends it. This approach effectively resolves the race condition issue. You can compile and run this in your environment to validate the behavior of the `SA_RESETHAND` flag.
