The program `sa_resethand_test` executed successfully in my environment and exited with an exit code of `0`. This indicates that all the checks for the `SA_RESETHAND` functionality passed as expected.

Here's the code for you to try in your environment:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Compile and run this program in your environment to test the `SA_RESETHAND` flag. The program will fork a child process that sends a `SIGINT` signal to the parent. The parent sets a signal handler for `SIGINT` with the `SA_RESETHAND` flag and verifies its setting. After receiving and handling the `SIGINT` signal, it checks that the signal handler has been reset to the default.
