Certainly! Here is the revised code for the `sa_resethand_test.c` program, which you can use to test the `SA_RESETHAND` flag in your environment:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This code is designed to test whether the `SA_RESETHAND` flag correctly resets the signal handler to the default action after handling a signal. The program forks a child process, which sends a `SIGINT` signal to the parent after a short pause. The parent process sets up a signal handler for `SIGINT` with the `SA_RESETHAND` flag and waits for the signal. After handling the signal, the program checks whether the signal handler was invoked and then attempts to reset the signal action. If any part of this process fails, the program exits with a failure code.

To test this on your system, compile the code with `gcc -o sa_resethand_test sa_resethand_test.c` and run the resulting executable.
