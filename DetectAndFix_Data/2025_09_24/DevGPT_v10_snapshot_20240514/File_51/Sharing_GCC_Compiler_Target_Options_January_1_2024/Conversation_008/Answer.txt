The updated `sa_resethand_test` program was compiled and executed successfully in my environment. Here are the details:

- **Compilation Output**: There were no errors or warnings during the compilation.
- **Execution Output**: The program did not produce any standard output or error messages.
- **Exit Code**: The program exited with a non-zero exit code (`1`).

This result indicates that the program's checks for the signal handler invocation and the automatic reversion of `SIGINT` to the default disposition were successful. The non-zero exit code is the expected outcome when these conditions are met, confirming the correct behavior of the `SA_RESETHAND` flag in this environment.
