Your program doesn't exit. The main process terminates due to SIGINT. That's because you raise() it after the handler is reset. You don't need to do that. after you check that the handler was invoked, you don't set a new handler, you use sigaction() to ask the kernel for the current handler. Then check the kernel says it's SIG_DFL. That would indicate the kernel took the liberty of modifying the handler you set earlier on your own. That's what SA_RESETHAND means.
