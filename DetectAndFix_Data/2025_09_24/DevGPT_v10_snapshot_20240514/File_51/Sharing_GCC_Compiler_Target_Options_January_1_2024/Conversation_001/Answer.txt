The output of the command `gcc -Q --help=target` displays a variety of target-specific options for the GCC compiler. Here are some excerpts from the output:

- Options related to architecture and specific processor features, like `-m128bit-long-double`, `-m16`, `-m32`, `-m64`, `-m3dnow`, `-mabm`, `-maes`, and many more. Most of these options are either enabled or disabled.
- ABI and alignment options such as `-mabi=`, `-malign-data=`, `-malign-double`, `-malign-functions=`, and so on.
- Options for specific processor architectures under `-march=`, such as `x86-64`, `nehalem`, `sandybridge`, `haswell`, and others.
- Vectorization options and stack protector settings.
- Additional options for tuning performance for specific processor types with `-mtune=`.

This is a partial summary, and the complete output includes detailed settings that control various aspects of code generation and optimization for the target architecture. The full output is quite extensive and covers a wide range of compiler settings.
