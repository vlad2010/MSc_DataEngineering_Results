The modified `sa_resethand_test` program was compiled and executed successfully. Here are the details of the execution:

- **Compilation Output**: There were no compilation errors or warnings.
- **Execution Output**: The program did not produce any standard output or error messages.
- **Exit Code**: The program exited with a non-zero exit code (`1`).

This behavior indicates that the `SA_RESETHAND` flag worked as expected. The signal handler was triggered by the SIGINT signal sent by the child process and then reset to the default action, leading to the program's termination with a non-zero exit code. This outcome suggests that the POSIX conformance of the host operating system's implementation of signal handling for `SA_RESETHAND` is correct in this environment.
