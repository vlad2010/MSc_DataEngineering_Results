The updated `sa_resethand_test` program was successfully compiled and executed in my environment. Here are the details:

- **Compilation Output**: No errors or warnings during compilation.
- **Execution Output**: No standard output or error messages produced.
- **Exit Code**: The program exited with an exit code of `0`.

This result indicates that the program passed all the checks:
1. The initial `sigaction` call successfully set the signal handler.
2. The sanity check confirmed that the signal handler for `SIGINT` was correctly set to the custom handler.
3. The signal handler was invoked by the `SIGINT` signal sent by the child process.
4. After handling the signal, the program verified that the signal action for `SIGINT` was reset to the default (`SIG_DFL`).

The exit code `0` signifies that all these conditions were met as expected, confirming the correct behavior of the `SA_RESETHAND` flag in this environment.
