Certainly! Here's the implementation for the modified `zigzag` functions:

1. **Cleaner Zigzag Function Signature:**

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This implementation separates the zigzag traversal into `zigzagLeft` and `zigzagRight` functions, each handling the left and right traversal, respectively. The `path` vector is passed by reference to avoid unnecessary copying. The final `zigzag` function calls these helper functions and returns the longer zigzag path.
