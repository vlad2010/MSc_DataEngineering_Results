Could you make comments for these new functions using this comment example?

/*
 *  zigzag(): Returns the vector with the longest path.
 *  parameters: binTreeNode * r - node to be passed in
 *              bool childType - determines which side the node is on
 *              std::vector<std::string> path - the current zigzag path
 *  return value: Returns a string vector.
 *  Algorithm: Calls each side recursively, and compares the two longest paths. If the node is on the left side, it checks the child's right
 *             side and see if it's nullptr. If it's not nullptr, then the current node is added to path and recursively calls itself on both
 *             sides of the child. However, depending on what side, the vector that is passed in is either path or an empty vector. This entire
 *             process happens on the left side as well.
