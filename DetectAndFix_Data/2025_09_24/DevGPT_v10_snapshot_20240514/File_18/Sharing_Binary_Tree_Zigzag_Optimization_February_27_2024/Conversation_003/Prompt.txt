Could you make the changes for these suggestions?

Cleaner Zigzag Function Signature:
Instead of passing a boolean childType to the zigzag function, consider creating separate functions for left and right traversal. This could make the code cleaner and more intuitive.

Parameter Passing by Reference in Zigzag:
Similar to the suggestion for the previous zigzag function, consider passing the path vector by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
