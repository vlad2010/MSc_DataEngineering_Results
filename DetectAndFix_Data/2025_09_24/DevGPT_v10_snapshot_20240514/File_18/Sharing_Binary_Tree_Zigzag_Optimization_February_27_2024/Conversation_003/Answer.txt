Certainly! Here are the modified parts of the code based on your suggestions:

1. **Cleaner Zigzag Function Signature:**
   Instead of using a boolean `childType`, create separate functions for left and right traversal.

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

2. **Parameter Passing by Reference in Zigzag:**
   Pass the `path` vector by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

This way, you have separate functions for left and right zigzag traversals, and the `path` vector is passed by reference, reducing unnecessary copying.
