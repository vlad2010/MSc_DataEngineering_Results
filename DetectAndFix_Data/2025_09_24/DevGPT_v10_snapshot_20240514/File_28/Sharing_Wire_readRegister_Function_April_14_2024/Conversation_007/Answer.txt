Certainly! Here's the revised `Wire_scan` function that uses the `Wire_writeBytes` function to attempt communication with the device at the specified I2C address. Since we are only checking for the presence of the device and not actually sending any data, we'll just try to start communication and see if we get an acknowledgment:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

In this updated version:
- We use `Wire_writeBytes` to send the address to the device. 
- The function will return `true` if an acknowledgment is received (indicating a device is present at that address).
- It returns `false` otherwise, meaning no device acknowledged the address. 

This approach simplifies the scan function while still maintaining its purpose of detecting whether a device is present at the given I2C address. Since `Wire_writeBytes` already handles starting and stopping the I2C communication, this makes the scan function very efficient and clean.
