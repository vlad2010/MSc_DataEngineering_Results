I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question. You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications. Please write code where detected security issue is fixed, please write all code in one code fragment.
(```c
#include <SoftI2C.h>

bool Wire_writeBytes(uint8_t i2caddr, uint8_t *data, uint8_t bytes) {
    uint8_t ack_bit;

    I2CStart();
    ack_bit = I2CSend(i2caddr << 1 | 0); // Shift address and append write bit
    if (ack_bit != 0) {
        I2CStop();
        return false;
    }

    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < bytes; i++) {
        if (I2CSend(data[i]) != 0) {
            I2CStop();
            return false;
        }
    }

    I2CStop();
    return true;
}
