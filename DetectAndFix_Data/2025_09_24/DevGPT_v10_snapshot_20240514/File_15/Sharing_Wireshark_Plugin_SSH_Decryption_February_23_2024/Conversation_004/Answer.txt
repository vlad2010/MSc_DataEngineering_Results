Next, we will explore the `ssh_key_handler.c` file. This part of the plugin deals with loading, parsing, and preparing the SSH key for use in decryption processes. The implementation details can vary depending on the key format (e.g., PEM, OpenSSH) and the encryption algorithm.

### `ssh_key_handler.c`

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

### Explanation

- **Key Loading**: The `load_ssh_private_key` function demonstrates how to load an SSH private key from a file. This example assumes the key is stored in a format directly usable by Libgcrypt's `gcry_sexp_new` function, which may not be the case for keys in PEM or other formats. For those, additional parsing steps would be necessary.

- **File Handling**: The function reads the entire key file into memory. This is a common approach but requires careful handling of resources, especially ensuring that the file is closed and the allocated memory is freed in case of errors.

- **Key Conversion**: The example converts the key file content directly into a S-expression, which is required by Libgcrypt for cryptographic operations. The actual conversion process depends heavily on the format of your key file.

This file is essential for enabling the decryption functionality of your Wireshark plugin by providing the necessary private key. Depending on the key format, you may need additional libraries or code to parse and properly format the key for decryption operations.

The given implementation is quite basic and would likely need to be expanded with more robust error checking, support for various key formats, and integration with the rest of the plugin to use the loaded key in the decryption process.
