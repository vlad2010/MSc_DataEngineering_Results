It seems you've requested to continue, but we've covered all the main components necessary for creating a Wireshark plugin to decrypt SSH connections, including:

1. **`ssh_decryptor.c`**: The main plugin file for integrating with Wireshark and handling packet dissection.
2. **`ssh_utils.c`**: Contains utility functions for cryptographic operations.
3. **`ssh_key_handler.c`**: Manages SSH key loading and processing.
4. **`Makefile`**: Automates the compilation and installation of the plugin.

If you're looking for further guidance, have specific questions about the code, or need assistance with another part of the plugin or a different topic altogether, please let me know how I can assist you further!
