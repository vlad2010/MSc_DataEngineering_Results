Here are some possible refactors for the provided C script:

1. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling for file operations such as opening and reading files.

2. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Instead of using magic numbers like 4 and 7, define constants with meaningful names for sizes of arrays and strings.

3. **Use snprintf Safely**: Ensure that snprintf doesn't exceed the bounds of the destination buffer.

4. **Memory Management**: Use dynamic memory allocation only when necessary. In this case, reading the file content can be done more efficiently.

5. **Consistent Naming**: Ensure consistent naming conventions throughout the code.

6. **Modularize the Code**: Break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions for better readability and maintainability.

Here's the refactored code incorporating these changes:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

These refactorings enhance readability, maintainability, and robustness of the code.
