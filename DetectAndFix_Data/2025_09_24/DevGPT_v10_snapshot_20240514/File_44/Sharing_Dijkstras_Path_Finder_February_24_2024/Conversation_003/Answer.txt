Given the request for a different approach that doesn't rely on `calloc` and focuses on tracking and updating the best path directly in an array, let's rethink the solution. The strategy here involves maintaining a "best path" array while traversing the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. Since we're looking for the shortest time, we'll compare paths using `ssmap_path_travel_time` for the final decision on the best path. We'll follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize necessary arrays and variables to keep track of distances, predecessors, and a flag to check if a node has been visited.
2. **Best Path Array**: Use a dynamic approach to update the best path as we find shorter paths.
3. **Final Path Calculation**: Once we find the path to the `end_id`, we use `ssmap_path_travel_time` to compare it with the current best path and update it if better.

Due to the nature of the problem, we'll slightly adjust the process to fit your requirements:

1. **Maintain a List of Current Paths**: Instead of using a min-heap, we'll explore nodes based on the current best distances but will focus on updating paths more dynamically.
2. **Update Paths Dynamically**: As we explore nodes and their neighbors, update the paths and their respective travel times.
3. **Determine the Best Path at the End**: Use the travel time comparison to keep only the best path.

This approach deviates from the traditional Dijkstra's algorithm due to the specific instructions. Note that without `calloc`, careful initialization of arrays is necessary to avoid uninitialized values.

Here's a conceptual implementation:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This code is conceptual and needs adjustments to work correctly within your specific context, especially around the connectivity check between nodes (`u` and `v`), updating distances based on actual travel times, and integrating `calculate_travel_time` properly. The approach simplifies some aspects to focus on the path finding and updating logic as requested.
