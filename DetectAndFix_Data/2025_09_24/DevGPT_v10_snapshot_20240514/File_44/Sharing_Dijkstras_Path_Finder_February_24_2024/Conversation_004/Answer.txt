To address the requirement while using a priority (min) heap and focusing on storing and updating the best path, we will integrate the heap for efficient minimum distance retrieval. We'll maintain dynamic arrays or lists for path tracking. This revised approach involves:

1. **Using a Min Heap**: For efficient retrieval of the current shortest distance node.
2. **Tracking Paths and Distances**: Keeping track of distances to each node from the start node and their predecessors for path reconstruction.
3. **Updating and Comparing Paths**: Dynamically updating the best path using `ssmap_path_travel_time` as we find potential paths to the destination.

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Initialize distances, predecessors, and a visited flag for each node. Use a min heap for nodes prioritized by their current shortest distance.
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implement the algorithm, updating distances to each node based on travel time.
3. **Path Reconstruction and Comparison**: After updating distances, reconstruct potential paths to the destination, compare them using `ssmap_path_travel_time`, and keep the shortest one.
4. **Output the Best Path**: Once the algorithm completes, output the best path found.

Here's a C code implementation incorporating these steps:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This implementation assumes the existence of a min heap and its operations (`create_min_heap`, `min_heap_insert`, `min_heap_extract_min`, `min_heap_decrease_key`, and `is_min_heap_empty`), which you should have defined elsewhere in your code. It also uses placeholders for `calculate_travel_time` and `ssmap_path_travel_time` which should be replaced with actual implementations.

Please, ensure you have the actual implementations for the min heap operations and the travel time calculation functions. The code prioritizes simplicity and clarity to demonstrate the algorithm's core logic.
