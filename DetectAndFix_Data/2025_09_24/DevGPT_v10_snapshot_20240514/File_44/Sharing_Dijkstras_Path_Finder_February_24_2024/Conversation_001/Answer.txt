To implement `ssmap_path_create` using Dijkstra's algorithm in C, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize a min heap to store nodes by their minimum travel time from the start node.
2. Set up an array to keep track of the best travel times found so far for each node.
3. Use an array to track the predecessor of each node in the path leading to it.
4. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path based on travel time.
5. Once the shortest path is found, backtrack using the predecessor array to print the path from the start node to the end node.

First, let's write the pseudocode for clarity:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

Now, let's translate this into C code:

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

This implementation assumes the existence of a properly defined `MinHeap` and its operations, as well as the `calculate_travel_time` and `ssmap_path_travel_time` functions. Make sure to adjust the code to fit into your existing codebase and properly integrate with the actual definitions and implementations of the `MinHeap` and travel time calculation functions.
