In most programming languages, a standard hashmap or hash table does not inherently maintain a sorted order of its elements. Hashmaps are designed for efficient key-based access, insertion, and deletion, but they do not guarantee any specific order of iteration.

However, if you need a data structure that combines the features of a hashmap with a specific order, you might consider using:

### 1. **Ordered Map or Sorted Map:**
   - Some programming languages and libraries provide a specialized data structure that combines the properties of a hashmap and an ordered collection. In Python, for example, you can use `collections.OrderedDict`. In C++, `std::map` or `std::unordered_map` can be used, with the former maintaining the order based on keys.

### 2. **TreeMap:**
   - In languages like Java, there's a `TreeMap` class in the `java.util` package. This is an implementation of the `SortedMap` interface, and it uses a Red-Black tree to maintain a sorted order based on keys.

### 3. **LinkedHashMap:**
   - Some languages provide a `LinkedHashMap`, which maintains the order of insertion. While it doesn't sort elements based on their keys, it can provide a predictable order based on the order in which elements were added.

### 4. **Custom Implementation:**
   - You can implement a custom data structure that combines a hashmap with a separate structure (like an array or linked list) to maintain the order of insertion or a specific sorting criteria.

Here's an example in Python using `collections.OrderedDict`:

[CODE_BLOCK_0]

This will output:

[CODE_BLOCK_1]

Remember that the specific data structure available to you may depend on the programming language you are using. Always check the documentation for the standard libraries of your chosen language to see what data structures are available for your needs.
