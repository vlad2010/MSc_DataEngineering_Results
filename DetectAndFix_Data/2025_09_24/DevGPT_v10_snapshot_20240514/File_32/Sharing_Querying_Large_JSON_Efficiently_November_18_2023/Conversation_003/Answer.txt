If you need to query the first N elements in sorted order, then data structures that inherently maintain a sorted order or can be easily queried in sorted order would be more suitable. Here are a few options:

### 1. **Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees (e.g., AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees):**
   - **Insertion:** O(log n)
   - **Deletion:** O(log n)
   - **Query (Sorted):** O(N)

   Self-balancing binary search trees maintain a sorted order, making it easy to query the first N elements in sorted order. However, the query operation would be O(N) as it involves traversing the tree in-order.

### 2. **Skip Lists:**
   - **Insertion:** O(log n)
   - **Deletion:** O(log n)
   - **Query (Sorted):** O(N)

   Similar to self-balancing binary search trees, skip lists maintain a sorted order, and you can efficiently query the first N elements in sorted order. The query operation would involve traversing the skip list horizontally at each level.

### 3. **Heap (Binary Heap, Fibonacci Heap):**
   - **Insertion:** O(log n)
   - **Deletion:** O(log n)
   - **Query (Sorted):** O(N log N)

   Although heaps are not inherently sorted data structures, you can use a heap and perform N extract-min operations to get the first N elements in sorted order. The overall complexity would be O(N log N).

### 4. **Priority Queue (with a Binary Heap or Fibonacci Heap):**
   - **Insertion:** O(log n)
   - **Deletion:** O(log n)
   - **Query (Sorted):** O(N log N)

   Similar to a heap, a priority queue can be used to get the first N elements in sorted order. The priority queue manages elements based on their priority.

### 5. **Array with Sorting:**
   - **Insertion:** O(N)
   - **Deletion:** O(N)
   - **Query (Sorted):** O(N log N)

   If the dataset is not frequently changing, you could maintain an array and sort it whenever necessary. This approach would be efficient for querying the first N elements in sorted order.

Choose the data structure based on your specific use case and the frequency of insertions, deletions, and queries. If your data is relatively static or doesn't change frequently, using a sorted data structure with a slower insertion and deletion but fast query time might be suitable. If the dataset changes frequently, you might need to consider a trade-off between insertion/deletion and query efficiency.
