To achieve constant query times for a data structure with N elements and fast insertion and deletion, you generally want to consider data structures that provide amortized constant time for these operations. Here are a few data structures that fit these criteria:

### 1. **Hash Tables:**
   - **Insertion (Average):** O(1)
   - **Deletion (Average):** O(1)
   - **Query (Average):** O(1)

   Hash tables provide constant time average-case performance for insertion, deletion, and querying. However, in some cases, worst-case performance can degrade to O(n), but this is rare and can be mitigated with proper design and hashing functions.

### 2. **Unordered Sets/Maps (C++ Standard Library):**
   - **Insertion (Average):** O(1)
   - **Deletion (Average):** O(1)
   - **Query (Average):** O(1)

   Many programming languages provide built-in support for unordered sets and maps, which are often implemented using hash tables.

### 3. **Skip Lists:**
   - **Insertion:** O(log n)
   - **Deletion:** O(log n)
   - **Query:** O(log n) on average

   Skip lists are a data structure that maintains a sorted list of elements with multiple layers of linked lists, allowing for efficient skipping during search operations. They provide logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and queries on average.

### 4. **Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees (e.g., AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees):**
   - **Insertion:** O(log n)
   - **Deletion:** O(log n)
   - **Query:** O(log n)

   Self-balancing binary search trees guarantee logarithmic height, ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, and query times. AVL trees and Red-Black trees are examples of such structures.

### 5. **Array (with Dynamic Resizing):**
   - **Insertion (Amortized):** O(1)
   - **Deletion (Amortized):** O(1)
   - **Query:** O(1)

   If the range of possible elements is known and not too large, using an array with dynamic resizing (like a dynamic array or ArrayList) can provide constant amortized time for insertions and deletions, as well as constant time for queries.

### 6. **Cuckoo Hashing:**
   - **Insertion:** O(1)
   - **Deletion:** O(1)
   - **Query:** O(1)

   Cuckoo hashing is a variant of hash tables that ensures constant time for insertion, deletion, and query operations. It resolves collisions by displacing existing elements to alternative hash locations.

Choose the data structure based on your specific requirements and constraints, such as the characteristics of your data, the operations you perform most frequently, and the memory resources available. Keep in mind that constant time is often achieved on average, and worst-case scenarios may need to be considered for critical applications.
