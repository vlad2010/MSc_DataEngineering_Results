Certainly! Here’s a security review of your code from a senior software developer and security perspective:

## Analysis

Your code is generally safe for its current use, but there are some subtle issues and best practices to consider:

### 1. Use of `sizeof` for Array Length Calculation

**Issue:**  
The expression `sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0])` is safe **only** when used in the same scope as the array declaration. If you pass `numbers` to a function, it decays to a pointer, and `sizeof(numbers)` would then return the size of the pointer, not the array.

**CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**  
If the code is refactored in the future (e.g., the loop is moved to a function), this could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Fix:**  
If you want to make the code robust and future-proof, pass the array length explicitly to any function that processes the array.

### 2. No Input/Output Validation

**Issue:**  
While your code does not take user input, always be cautious with output functions. In this case, `printf` is safe because the format string is constant and the data is integer.

**CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String**  
Not an issue here, but always use constant format strings.

### 3. General Best Practices

- Use `size_t` for array indices and sizes, as `sizeof` returns `size_t`.
- Avoid magic numbers; define array size with a macro or `const`.

## Improved and Secure Version

Here’s a version that addresses the above points and is robust for future changes:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stddef.h> // for size_t

#define ARRAY_SIZE(arr) (sizeof(arr) / sizeof((arr)[0]))

void print_array(const int *numbers, size_t length) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    // Initialize an array of integers
    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Print the array elements
    print_array(numbers, ARRAY_SIZE(numbers));

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Fixes

- **ARRAY_SIZE macro**: Safely computes array size at compile time.
- **size_t**: Used for array indices and lengths.
- **Function for printing**: Demonstrates safe passing of array and length, avoiding pointer decay issues (CWE-119).

## Summary Table

| Issue | CWE | Fix |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Array size calculation may be unsafe if refactored | CWE-119 | Pass array length explicitly |
| Use of int for index | N/A (Best Practice) | Use size_t |
| Magic numbers | N/A (Best Practice) | Use macro for array size |
