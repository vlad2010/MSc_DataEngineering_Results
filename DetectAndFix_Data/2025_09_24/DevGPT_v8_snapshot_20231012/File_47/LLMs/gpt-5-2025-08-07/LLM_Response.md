Senior security review

Overview
- As written, this program is safe: it uses a fixed-size local array, prints with a constant format string, and stays within bounds.
- However, there is a common latent pitfall worth addressing proactively: using sizeof to compute array length only works for true arrays, not pointers. If this code is refactored (e.g., numbers becomes int* from malloc or passed into a function), sizeof(numbers) would yield the size of a pointer, not the whole buffer. That can lead to incorrect loop bounds and out-of-bounds access.

Relevant CWEs and potential consequences
- CWE-467: Use of sizeof on a Pointer Type — if numbers becomes a pointer, sizeof(numbers)/sizeof(numbers[0]) becomes wrong.
- CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size — incorrect element count leads to incorrect bounds.
- CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read and CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer — the usual downstream impact of the above miscalculation.
- CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound — less likely here, but using int for indices can be problematic with very large arrays; prefer size_t.

Hardening recommendations
- Compute the array length once and store it in a size_t.
- Enforce at compile time that the operand to the length macro is an actual array (not a pointer) to prevent accidental misuse (guards against CWE-467/CWE-131).
- Use size_t for indices to avoid signed/unsigned issues and potential overflow on large sizes.

Hardened code (single fragment)
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stddef.h>

/*
 * Robust ARRAY_LEN macro:
 * - Computes the number of elements in a true array.
 * - Triggers a compile-time error if passed a pointer (guards against CWE-467/CWE-131).
 * Works on GCC/Clang; falls back to a plain sizeof-based version elsewhere.
