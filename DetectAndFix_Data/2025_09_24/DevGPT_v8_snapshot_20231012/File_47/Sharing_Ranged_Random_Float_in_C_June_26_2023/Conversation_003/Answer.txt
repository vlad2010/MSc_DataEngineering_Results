ChatGPTTo declare a static method in a C++ header file and implement it in a source file, you can follow these steps:Create a header file (e.g., MyClass.h) and declare the static method inside the class declaration. Use the static keyword to indicate that it's a static method. Here's an example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Create a source file (e.g., MyClass.cpp) and include the header file. Implement the static method using the scope resolution operator :: to specify the class name. Here's an example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]You can then use the MyClass and its static method in other parts of your program by including the header file MyClass.h.Here's an example usage:[CODE_BLOCK_2]In this example, the staticMethod is declared as a static method inside the MyClass class in the header file. Then, in the source file, MyClass.cpp, the method is implemented using the scope resolution operator :: to specify the class name.Finally, in the main function of the program, we call the static method using the class name and the scope resolution operator ::.Note that it's important to include the header file in the source file where the implementation resides to ensure that the declaration matches the definition.
