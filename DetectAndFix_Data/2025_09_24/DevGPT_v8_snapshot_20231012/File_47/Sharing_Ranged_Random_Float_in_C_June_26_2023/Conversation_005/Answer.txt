ChatGPTTo iterate over an std::list in C++, you can use either a range-based for loop or an iterator. Here's an example of both approaches:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, we have an std::list<int> called myList containing elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.Using a range-based for loop:
The range-based for loop simplifies iterating over a container. Each element of the list is assigned to the variable num, and then we can perform operations on each element directly within the loop.Using an iterator:
We declare an iterator it of type std::list<int>::iterator and initialize it with myList.begin(), which points to the beginning of the list. The loop condition it != myList.end() checks whether the iterator has reached the end of the list. Within the loop, we can access the value of the current element using *it.Both approaches will output the same result, which is the elements of the list separated by spaces.Remember to include the <list> header for using the std::list container and the <iostream> header for console output in this example.
