ChatGPTBased on your code, it seems like you've implemented streak tracking correctly in your FootballProcessor class. However, I noticed that you're resetting the streaks for both home and away teams whenever there's a draw. This would cause both teams to have their streaks reset when there's a draw, which is not what you want.To fix this issue and ensure that streaks are properly updated, you should only reset the streaks for the specific team that has drawn the match. Here's how you can modify the UpdateStreak method to handle draws correctly:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this modification, when there's a draw, only the streaks of the teams involved in the draw will be reset, and the streaks of the winning and losing teams will continue as expected.Make sure to update your FootballProcessor class with this change, and it should correctly track streaks for wins, draws, and losses.
