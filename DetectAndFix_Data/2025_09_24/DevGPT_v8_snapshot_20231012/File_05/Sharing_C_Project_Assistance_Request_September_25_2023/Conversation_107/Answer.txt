ChatGPTI understand now. You want the matches for rounds 9 to 1 in reverse order, and I should exclude the scores. Here's the CSV data for rounds 9 to 1 in the format you requested:Round 9.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Round 8.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Round 7.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Round 6.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Round 5.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Round 4.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_5]Round 3.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_6]Round 2.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_7]Round 1.csv:[CODE_BLOCK_8]These files are now in reverse order (round 9 to 1) without scores. If you need any further adjustments or have more requests, please let me know.
