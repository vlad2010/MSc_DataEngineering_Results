ChatGPTAbsolutely, it's a good practice to make your code more flexible so that other people can easily load files in their environment. Here are a few improvements you can make:Relative File Paths: Instead of hardcoding absolute file paths, use relative paths. You can reference files relative to the application's directory. This makes it easier for others to run your program on their machines.[CODE_BLOCK_0]This assumes that the setup.csv and teams.csv files are located in a folder named "Data" within your project directory.Prompt for File Paths: Instead of hardcoding the file paths in your code, prompt the user to enter the file paths interactively. This allows users to specify the file locations when they run the program.[CODE_BLOCK_1]This way, users can provide their own file paths at runtime.Check File Existence: Before attempting to load data from the files, check if the files exist. If they don't, you can provide a helpful error message to the user.[CODE_BLOCK_2]By making these changes, your program will be more user-friendly and easier for others to use. Users will be prompted to enter the file paths, and they can place their data files in the "Data" directory of the project. This approach also avoids hardcoding specific paths that may not exist on other users' machines.
