ChatGPTThank you for sharing your code. Based on the code you provided, the streak calculation and updating logic appears to be correct. The UpdateStreakForTeam method updates the streak for each team based on whether they won, drew, or lost the match, and it appears to be properly implemented.The issue you're experiencing where the streak breaks when simulating all matches might be due to some external factors, such as how the round files are structured or how the matches are being processed when simulating all matches.Here are some troubleshooting steps to consider:Check Round Files: Ensure that the round files (round-1.csv, round-2.csv, etc.) are correctly formatted and contain the match results in the expected format. Any discrepancies in the round files could lead to incorrect streak calculations.Logging and Debugging: Add logging or debugging statements to your code to track the progress of each round file being processed when simulating all matches. This can help you identify at which point the streak calculations might be going wrong.Order of Processing: Make sure that you're processing the round files in the correct order, as it's possible that processing them out of order could affect the streak calculations.Reset Streak: Ensure that the streak for each team is correctly reset at the start of each new season or when needed to prevent any carryover from the previous season affecting the current season's streak.Error Handling: Implement error handling and validation to handle cases where unexpected data or errors might occur when processing round files. This can help prevent issues from propagating.Test with Smaller Dataset: If possible, create a smaller dataset with a few rounds and matches to isolate the issue. This can help you pinpoint the problem more easily.External Factors: Consider if any external factors or changes in the data might be affecting the streak calculations, such as changes in the team data or setup data.By carefully reviewing and debugging your code while paying attention to the points mentioned above, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the streak calculations when simulating all matches.
