ChatGPTIt seems like you have encountered an issue where the teams are playing more matches (e.g., 27) than the allowed 22 matches. This discrepancy might indeed be due to the content of your CSV files.To address this issue, you should verify the content of your CSV files, especially the round files that contain match results. Here are some steps to check:Check Match Result CSV Files: Review the content of the CSV files that store the match results (e.g., round-1.csv, round-2.csv, etc.). Make sure that each round file contains the correct number of matches, and that no extra matches are included. Ensure that the team abbreviations are correctly matched to the teams in your team data.Check Round Files: Verify that the round files are correctly structured with the appropriate headers and data. Each line should represent a match with the home team, away team, and score.Check the Logic: Review the logic in your program that processes these CSV files. Ensure that you are not inadvertently processing the same round file multiple times.Check Data Initialization: Make sure that when you initialize your teams' data at the beginning of your application, you are correctly setting the number of games each team should play to 22.If you are still facing issues, you may need to provide more specific details about the content of your CSV files and any relevant code, so I can assist you further in identifying the problem.Additionally, it's a good practice to have error-checking and validation mechanisms in your code to handle unexpected or incorrect data in the CSV files gracefully, providing informative error messages when necessary.
