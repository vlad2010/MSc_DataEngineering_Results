Here's how you can do it:First, make sure you import the necessary libraries at the top of your Program.cs file:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, modify your ProcessRoundResults method like this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This modification will generate random scores for each match in your round file and update the CSV file with these random scores. Make sure you implement the UpdateTeamStatistics method to update the team statistics based on the random scores generated for each match.
