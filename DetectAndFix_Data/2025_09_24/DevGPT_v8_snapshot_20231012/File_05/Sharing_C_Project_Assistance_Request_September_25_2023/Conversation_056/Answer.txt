ChatGPTTo generate random scores for matches in the FootballProcessor class, you can create a new method called GenerateRandomScores and integrate it into your existing code. Here's how you can do it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code:We create a new method GenerateRandomScores that takes the roundFilePath as an argument.Inside this method, we read the match results from the specified round file using MatchResultProcessor.ReadMatchResults.We use a Random object to generate random scores for each match. The random.Next(0, 5) function generates a random number between 0 and 4, which represents the number of goals scored by each team.We update the HomeTeamGoals and AwayTeamGoals properties of each match result with the generated random scores.Finally, we save the updated match results back to the round file using MatchResultProcessor.SaveMatchResults.Ensure that you have the MatchResultProcessor class or similar methods for reading and saving match results from the round file. If you don't have this class, you can adapt the code accordingly to read and save match results from your CSV file.With this addition, when you choose option 2 to run matches, the scores will be generated randomly for each match in the specified round file.
