ChatGPTApologies for the oversight. Let's ensure that the C++ code using libcurl provided earlier is indeed equivalent to the given curl command. Upon a closer look, I noticed that we missed setting the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION option in the C++ code, which is necessary for reading data from a memory buffer. Additionally, we need to set the correct CURLOPT_READDATA for the email data.Here's the updated C++ code using libcurl:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this updated code, we have included the read_data_callback function to handle reading the email data and made sure to set the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION and CURLOPT_READDATA options correctly. This C++ code using libcurl should now be equivalent to the given curl command for sending the email.
