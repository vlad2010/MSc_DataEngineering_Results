ChatGPTCertainly! The reset function will write the value 0b10000 to the bottom 5 bits of the GO_COMMAND register.Here's how you could implement this function:Function to perform a reset[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, an Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits object is used to access the bottom 5 bits (bit indexes 0 to 4) of the GO_COMMAND register. We then write 0b10000 to those bits to perform the reset.Does this function meet your requirements?
