ChatGPTI apologize for the oversight. Thank you for providing the correct prototype. Given that, the Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits constructor takes three arguments:A pointer to the Adafruit_I2CRegister object that represents the register.The number of bits you want to read or write.The starting bit position (bit shift).With this in mind, let's correct the getPDResponse() function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this corrected version, the Adafruit_I2CRegisterBits object is initialized to read 3 bits starting from the 3rd bit (bit index 3). The read() function then reads those bits and returns their value.Does this revised implementation look good to you?
