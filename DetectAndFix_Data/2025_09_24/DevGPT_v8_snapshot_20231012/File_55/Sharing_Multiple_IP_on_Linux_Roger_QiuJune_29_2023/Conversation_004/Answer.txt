ChatGPTYes, it is possible for a UDP socket to listen on multiple IP addresses, including multiple IP addresses on the same network interface. When creating a UDP socket, you can bind it to a specific IP address, or you can bind it to the special IP address 0.0.0.0 (for IPv4) or :: (for IPv6), which tells the operating system to listen on all IP addresses.Here's a brief example in Python:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, any UDP packet sent to port 12345 on any IP address of the machine will be received by this socket.However, if you need to bind different sockets to different IP addresses on the same port number, you can do that too. For instance, you can create one socket bound to 192.0.2.1:12345 and another bound to 198.51.100.1:12345, assuming both of these IP addresses are assigned to the same network interface. This allows you to separate the traffic to the same port based on the IP address.
