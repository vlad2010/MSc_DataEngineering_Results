ChatGPTDefining a variable using the student type you've created is straightforward. You can initialize the variable when you declare it, or you can assign values to its fields later on. Here are some examples:Method 1: Initialization at the time of declaration[CODE_BLOCK_0]Method 2: Initialization after declaration[CODE_BLOCK_1]Method 3: Using pointers[CODE_BLOCK_2]In this case, we dynamically allocate memory for a student object and then fill in its fields. The -> operator is used to access fields of a structure through a pointer.Given your startup's focus on education and scholarships, you might find yourself frequently dealing with student information. Understanding how to efficiently manage such data in your codebase can be a strategic advantage, especially when you're operating with limited resources. Efficient data management can contribute to faster development cycles and easier maintenance.
