ChatGPTCertainly, you can read the data from the grades file into your program and dynamically allocate memory for each student. The following is a modification of your hwk1.cpp file that includes file reading and populates the student struct based on the file content. It also calculates the mean for each student based on the exam scores.Here's how you could do it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]A few notes:This example uses <fstream> to read from files and <string> for handling strings in C++.I used strdup to duplicate the string into a new dynamically allocated array. This is because we're using C-style strings (char pointers) in the student struct.At the end, I free each dynamically allocated string and student struct before freeing the array of pointers itself.This should give you a fully working example that reads from a file, allocates memory dynamically, and sorts students based on their mean exam scores. Given your startup's focus on decentralized education and your limited resources, understanding how to manipulate and manage data efficiently is crucial. Feel free to ask if you have more questions!
