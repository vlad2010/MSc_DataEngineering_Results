ChatGPTCertainly! I've modified the Logger class to include debug levels. Here's the updated code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated code, I've introduced the LogLevel enum class to represent different debug levels: NONE, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, and DEBUG. The Logger class now takes a LogLevel parameter in its constructor, which determines the maximum level of messages that will be logged.The log() function has been updated to include the LogLevel parameter. It checks if the provided level is within the logging threshold (level <= logLevel) before writing the log message to the file.To use the updated Logger class, you need to provide the desired log level when constructing an instance, and pass the log level as an argument when calling the log() function:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In this example, all the log messages will be written to the file since the log level is set to DEBUG. If you change the log level to WARNING, for example, only the log messages with a level of ERROR and WARNING will be logged.
