ChatGPTCertainly! I can help you with that. Here's a simple example of a logging class in C++:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the Logger class takes a filename as a parameter in its constructor, and it opens the file in append mode. The log() function is a template function that allows logging various types of messages. It writes the current timestamp followed by the message to the log file.You can use the Logger class in your program like this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will create a log file called "log.txt" in the same directory as your program, and it will write the log messages to that file.Remember to include the necessary headers (<iostream>, <fstream>, <ctime>) and adjust the code as per your requirements.
