ChatGPTThe __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros are predefined macros in C++. They are part of the C++ standard library and are defined by the compiler.__FILE__ expands to a string literal that represents the current source file name. It typically contains the full path to the source file.__LINE__ expands to an integer literal that represents the current line number in the source file.These macros are useful for generating debug information and for providing context in log messages or error handling. The values they expand to are determined by the compiler during preprocessing, so they can vary depending on the compiler and the specific context of their usage.
