ChatGPTYes, it is possible to separate the code common for all emails (initialization of libcurl and the parameters to connect to the SMTP server) from the code needed to send a specific email. One way to achieve this is by creating a separate class or struct to handle the common email settings and initialization. This can be done using object-oriented programming concepts.Here's an example of how you can do it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this refactored code, we've created the EmailSender class to handle the common email settings and initialization. The EmailSender constructor initializes libcurl and sets up the SMTP server details. The ~EmailSender destructor ensures that the libcurl resources are cleaned up properly.The sendEmail method within the EmailSender class takes the recipients, subject, and body as parameters and handles the specific email sending functionality. The sendEmail method uses the same email sending code that was previously in the main function.This separation of concerns makes the code more organized, modular, and reusable. The EmailSender class can be used to send multiple emails with different content by creating an instance of EmailSender and calling the sendEmail method with the appropriate parameters.
