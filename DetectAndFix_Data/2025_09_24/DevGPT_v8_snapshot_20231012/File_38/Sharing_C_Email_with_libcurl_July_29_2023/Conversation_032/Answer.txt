We can encapsulate the code inside the main function into a new function called mail that takes a list of recipient email addresses, the subject, and the body of the email as input parameters and sends the email using libcurl. Here's the modified code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Now, the functionality for sending an email is encapsulated in the mail function, which takes the recipient email addresses, subject, and body as parameters. The main function simply calls the mail function with the appropriate data.This encapsulation makes the code more modular and allows you to easily use the mail function in other parts of your program or even in other projects.
