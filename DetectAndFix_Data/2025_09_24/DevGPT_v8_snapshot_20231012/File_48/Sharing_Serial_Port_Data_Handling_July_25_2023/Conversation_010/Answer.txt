ChatGPTThe problem may be due to the condition for scrolling the heart rate plot. In the code provided, scrolling is initiated when the size of heartRateTime exceeds 10 and the time for the newest data point (key) exceeds the upper limit of the current x-axis range. If heart rate data comes in less frequently, this could result in the x-axis range shifting too soon, causing most of the data points to fall outside of the x-axis range.To address this issue, we can keep track of the time when the first heart rate data point was received and start scrolling the x-axis 10 seconds after that time. Here's how you can modify the addHeartRateData() method:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Please make sure to define firstHeartRateTime as a private member of the MainWindow class:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This modification should ensure that the heart rate plot starts scrolling 10 seconds after the first heart rate data point, regardless of how many data points have been received.
