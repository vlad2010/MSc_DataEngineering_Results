I'm using Qt Creator to build a widget-based application that reads data from the serial port to and plots it for the user to see. I would like you to guide me through the process of gradually implementing this program. Right now I have a Qt project that builds successfully with QCustomPlot files included (which is a library I know I'll need for the plots) but I'd like to start with the code needed to handle the incoming serial data. Can you help me with this? The port is `COM8` and the baud rate is `115200`.
