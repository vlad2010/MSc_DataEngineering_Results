ChatGPTI apologize for the confusion. The key variable, which represents the x-coordinate (time), and data variable, which represents the y-coordinate (heart rate), are indeed local to the addHeartRateData() method and should be used within it.Here's the corrected addHeartRateData() method:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, key is the current time minus the start time, and data is the heart rate data received from the serial port. The setCoords(key, data) line moves the heartRateLabel to the latest data point (key, data) on the heart rate plot.
