ChatGPTGreat, I'm glad to hear the heart rate data is now appearing on the plot. Let's implement the scrolling behavior and auto-adjustment of the axes.For the ECG plot, to set the range of y-axis from -500 to 500, you can call setRange() on the y-axis like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]For the heart rate plot, instead of setting a fixed range for the y-axis, we will call rescale() on the y-axis each time we add new data. This will automatically adjust the range to fit the current data:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Also, to implement the scrolling behavior after 10 data points have been read, we will start shifting the range of the x-axis after we have 10 data points, similar to what we did with the ECG plot. Here's the updated addHeartRateData() method:[CODE_BLOCK_2]This will make your heart rate plot start scrolling after 10 data points have been read, and always adjust the y-axis to fit the current data. It will also discard older data points as new ones come in.
