ChatGPTSure, you can add a small margin to the axes so that the markers at the edge are fully visible. In QCustomPlot, this can be done using the setRange() function with the QCPRange class, which allows specifying both the lower and upper range of the axis.Here's how to add a margin of 1 to the y-axis of the heart rate plot in the addHeartRateData() function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The std::min_element and std::max_element functions are used to find the minimum and maximum of the heartRateTime and heartRateData vectors, respectively. A margin of 1 is added (or subtracted for the lower range) to the maximum (or minimum) value.Remember to include the <algorithm> header at the beginning of your mainwindow.cpp file:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Now the markers at the edge should be fully visible on the plot. If the markers are still cut off, you may need to increase the margin.
