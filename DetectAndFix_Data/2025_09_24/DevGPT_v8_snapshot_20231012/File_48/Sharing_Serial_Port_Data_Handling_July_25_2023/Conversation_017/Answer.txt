ChatGPTYes, you can add a numeric label to the latest data point on the heart rate plot using the QCPItemText class. QCPItemText objects are items that are placed onto the plot and move with the plot when it is panned or zoomed, as opposed to QCPTextElement objects which are part of the plot layout and stay in place.Here's how to add a label to the latest data point:First, you'll need to include the QCPItemText class at the beginning of your mainwindow.cpp file:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, add a QCPItemText member to the MainWindow class in your mainwindow.h file:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In your MainWindow constructor, create the QCPItemText object after you've created heartRatePlot:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Finally, in your addHeartRateData() function, move the label to the latest data point and update the text each time new data is received:[CODE_BLOCK_3]With these changes, the latest data point on the heart rate plot will have a label showing its value. The label will move with the data point as the plot is panned or zoomed. The setFont(), setColor(), and setPadding() calls are used to style the label. Adjust these to fit your needs.
