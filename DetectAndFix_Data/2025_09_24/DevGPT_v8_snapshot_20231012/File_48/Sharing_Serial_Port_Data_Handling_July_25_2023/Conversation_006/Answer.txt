ChatGPTAbsolutely, to slow down the "scrolling effect" of the plot, we can increase the range of x-axis which displays the data. So, if we want to display the last 10 seconds of data instead of just the last 1 second, we can change the x-axis range from (0, 1) to (0, 10). This will effectively make the scrolling 10 times slower.You can set the x-axis range to 0 to 10 initially:[CODE_BLOCK_0]And then update the addECGData() method like this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will make your ECG plot display the latest 10 seconds of data and discard the oldest samples as new ones come in, providing a slower scrolling effect. You can adjust the range to any other duration as per your needs.
