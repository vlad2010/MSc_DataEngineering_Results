ChatGPTTo make Generate10 function similar to Generate22 function while maintaining its distinct characteristics, you can follow the same method of creating two files per iteration of the loop. Hereâ€™s how you can approach this:In Generate10, for each iteration, two files have to be created, and you have to split the upper and lower teams to each file similarly to how Generate22 does with the teams. Here's a modified version of your Generate10 function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This modified version of Generate10 now creates two CSV files for each iteration of the loop (one for half of the upper teams and half of the lower teams, and the other for the remaining teams) and should make its behavior more similar to that of the Generate22 method.
