ChatGPTIn Python, access modifiers (public, private, and protected) work differently than in Java or C++. Python does not have strict access modifiers like private, protected, or public. Instead, it follows a convention to indicate the visibility of class members. Let's understand how this works with practical examples:Public:
In Python, all class members are considered public by default. This means that all attributes and methods of a class are accessible from outside the class.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this Python example, both the "brand" attribute and the "start()" method are considered public within the "Car" class. We can access and modify the "brand" attribute and call the "start()" method directly from outside the class.Protected:
In Python, there is a convention to indicate a protected attribute or method by prefixing its name with a single underscore "_". However, this is merely a convention, and the Python interpreter does not enforce any restrictions on accessing these attributes or methods.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In this Python example, the "_name" attribute and the "_make_sound()" method are considered protected, following the convention of prefixing them with a single underscore. However, Python does not prevent us from accessing these members directly. The convention is merely a way to communicate to other developers that these members are intended for internal use and might be subject to change.Private:
In Python, there is another convention to indicate a private attribute or method by prefixing its name with double underscores "__". Like with protected attributes, this is also a convention, and Python still allows accessing these members, but with a slight name-mangling applied.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_2]In this Python example, the "__balance" attribute and the "__deduct_fees()" method are considered private, following the convention of prefixing them with double underscores. When accessing these members from outside the class, Python applies name mangling by adding "_classname" as a prefix. This is to make the attribute or method harder to access accidentally but not for the sake of strong encapsulation.It is essential to understand that Python's approach to access modifiers relies on conventions rather than strict enforcement. Developers should follow these conventions to maintain code readability and respect the intended visibility of class members. However, it is still possible to access and modify these members directly if needed, as Python promotes a philosophy of "we are all consenting adults here."
