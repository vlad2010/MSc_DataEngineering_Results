I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question. You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications. Please write code where detected security issue is fixed, please write all code in one code fragment.
(```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;
    
    void deductFees() {
        // Some code to deduct fees from the balance
    }
    
public:
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }
    
    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount account;
    account.deposit(1000); // Accessing public method to deposit money
    // account.balance = 500; // Error: balance is private and not accessible
    // account.deductFees(); // Error: deductFees() is private and not accessible
    return 0;
}
