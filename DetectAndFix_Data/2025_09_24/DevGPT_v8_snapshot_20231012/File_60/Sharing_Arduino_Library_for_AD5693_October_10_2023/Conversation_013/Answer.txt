ChatGPTUsed Ai PDFI found the relevant information about the operating modes and the PD1 and PD0 bits. According to the datasheet, the operating modes are as follows:Normal Mode: PD1 = 0, PD0 = 01 kΩ Output Impedance: PD1 = 0, PD0 = 1100 kΩ Output Impedance: PD1 = 1, PD0 = 0Three-State Output Impedance: PD1 = 1, PD0 = 1You can create an enum to represent these operating modes by concatenating PD1 and PD0 into a two-bit value. Here's how you could define it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this enum, the values are based on the concatenated PD1 and PD0 bits. For example, for the "Normal Mode," PD1 and PD0 are both 0, so the enum value is 0x00. For the "1 kΩ Output Impedance," PD1 is 0 and PD0 is 1, which gives us 0x01, and so on.Would you like to proceed to the next part of the library?
