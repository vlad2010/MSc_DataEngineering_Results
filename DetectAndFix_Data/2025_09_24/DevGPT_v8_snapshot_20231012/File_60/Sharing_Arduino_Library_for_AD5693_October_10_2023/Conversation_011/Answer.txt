ChatGPTAh, I see. If the AD5693 requires all three bytes to be sent even when updating the DAC, you can modify the updateDAC() function to send three bytes, with the last two bytes set to 0x00.Here's the updated function with the Doxygen header:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated version, a 3-byte buffer is prepared. The first byte is the UPDATE_DAC command, and the next two bytes are set to 0x00. The write() method then sends all three bytes over I2C.Would you like to proceed to the next part of the library?
