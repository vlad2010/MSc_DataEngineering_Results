ChatGPTCertainly! The setMode() function will write to the control register to set the operating mode, enable or disable the reference, and set the gain. The function will use the WRITE_CONTROL command from the ad5693_commands enum.Here's the function implementation along with a Doxygen-compatible comment header:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this function, a 16-bit data variable is prepared to hold the values for the control register. The operating mode, reference enable/disable, and gain are set to their respective bits. The data variable is then split into high and low bytes, which are sent over I2C along with the WRITE_CONTROL command.Would you like to add anything else or proceed to the next part?
