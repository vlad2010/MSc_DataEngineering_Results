ChatGPTCertainly! The writeDAC(uint16_t value) function will use the write method from the Adafruit_I2CDevice class to send data over I2C. The function will need to format the data according to the AD5693's requirements, as specified in the datasheet.Here's a sample implementation:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the writeDAC function takes a 16-bit value as an argument. It then prepares a 3-byte buffer to send over I2C. The first byte is the command byte, and the next two bytes are the high and low bytes of the 16-bit value, respectively.The write method from Adafruit_I2CDevice is then used to send this 3-byte buffer over I2C.Would you like to add anything else to this function or proceed to the next part?
