ChatGPTThat sounds like an exciting project! Writing a library for the AD5693 chip in the style of Adafruit libraries will make it easier for others to use this chip in their Arduino projects.Before we proceed with writing the library, it would be helpful to understand the key functionalities and commands for the AD5693 chip as described in the datasheet. Would you like me to summarize the relevant portions of the datasheet for you?
