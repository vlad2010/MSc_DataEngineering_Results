hello, we are going to be writing an arduino C/C++ library in the same style as ladyada / limor fried / adafruit for the AD5693 chip. 
this library will comprise a header file, called Adafruit_chipname.h and Adafruit_chipname.cpp 
(where chipname is the part number of the chip) and a test example Arduino Sketch. 
the class name will also be Adafruit_chipname. 

here is the pdf datasheet that has explanations of the commands:
