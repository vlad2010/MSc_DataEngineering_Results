I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question. You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications. Please write code where detected security issue is fixed, please write all code in one code fragment.
(```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MIN_LINE_LENGTH 80
#define MAX_LINE_LENGTH 1000

int get_line(char line[], int max) {
  int c, i;

  for (i = 0; i < max - 1 && (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; i++) {
    line[i] = c;
  }
  
  if (c == '\n') {
    line[i] = c;
    ++i;
  }
  
  line[i] = '\0';  // Ensure the line is null-terminated.
  
  return i;
}

int main() {
  printf("=== This program will print all the lines that exceed 80 characters, "
         "exit by CTRL+D ===\n");

  char line[MAX_LINE_LENGTH];
  int line_length;

  while ((line_length = get_line(line, MAX_LINE_LENGTH)) > 0) {
    if (line_length > MIN_LINE_LENGTH) {
      printf("%s", line);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
