ChatGPTHere's my review of your program, divided into several points:===
The program indeed prints out all lines that are longer than 80 characters, but it unnecessarily collects them into a single string before printing. This requires extra memory and adds complexity to the program. The task can be accomplished simply by printing the line as soon as it is detected to exceed the minimum line length.===
The function get_line actually doesn't limit the line length to MAX_LINE_LENGTH, because the null character \0 is not added to the end of the string after reading the input. As a result, if the input line is longer than MAX_LINE_LENGTH, it will not be a valid C string, which may cause undefined behavior in the rest of your program.===
In add_line, you should add a null character to the end of container after copying the line into it. This is important because string functions like printf expect C strings to be null-terminated.===
Memory allocated by malloc or realloc for container may not be sufficient. For instance, if there are two consecutive lines, each with 80 characters, the second line will exceed MAX_LINE_LENGTH, causing the realloc to be called. However, the realloc only allocates total_length which is exactly enough for the characters, but there is no space for the null character.Overall grade: 65/100Here's the corrected version:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This revised version reads lines from input and immediately prints the ones that are longer than MIN_LINE_LENGTH. It ensures that the line array is null-terminated after each call to get_line. It does not need a container string or dynamic memory allocation, which makes it simpler and safer.
