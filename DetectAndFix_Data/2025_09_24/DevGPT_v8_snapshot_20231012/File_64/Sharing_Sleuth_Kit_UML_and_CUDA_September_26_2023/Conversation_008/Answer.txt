ChatGPTI'm genuinely sorry for the inconvenience and understand your frustration. Let me attempt to locate tsk/hashdb/binsrch_index.cpp once again with the correct path.Finished workingShow workI apologize for the continued inconvenience. It seems we are still unable to locate the binsrch_index.cpp file at the specified path, even though it does exist locally on your machine. It's quite perplexing, and I appreciate your patience.Since directly accessing the file is proving to be challenging, if you could open the file on your local system and share the contents or relevant portions of the binsrch_index.cpp file here, we can certainly proceed with analyzing the contents and discussing how it can be adapted for CUDA.Alternatively, if you have access to the file, you could upload it directly here, which would allow us to review the contents immediately.
