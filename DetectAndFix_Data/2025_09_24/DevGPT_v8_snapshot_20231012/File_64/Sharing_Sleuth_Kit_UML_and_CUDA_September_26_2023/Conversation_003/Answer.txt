ChatGPTYes, conducting a performance comparison between the original hfind and a CUDA-accelerated version is a great approach to quantifying the benefits of parallelization.Obtaining File Hashes1. Generate Your Own Hashes:You can indeed generate your own hashes from files on your C or D drive. You can use hashing utilities or write a small script to hash every file in a directory and its subdirectories and save the hashes to a file.Here is a simple Python example that generates MD5 hashes for all files in a specified directory:[CODE_BLOCK_0]2. Online Repositories:There are also online repositories and datasets available that contain precomputed hashes of files. For example, the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) provides a collection of known file hashes:National Software Reference Library (NSRL) - Downloadable Hash SetsThe NSRL hash sets can be downloaded and used to perform your performance comparison tests with hfind.Project Steps:Preparation:Obtain or generate a set of file hashes.Prepare the hash database for hfind.Baseline Testing:Perform lookups using the original hfind and measure the time taken on varying sizes of hash databases.CUDA Acceleration:Review the hfind source code and implement a CUDA-accelerated version of the binary search used in hfind.CUDA Testing:Perform the same lookups using the CUDA-accelerated hfind and measure the time taken.Analysis:Compare the results and analyze the performance improvements gained through CUDA acceleration.Presentation:Prepare a presentation or report documenting your methodology, implementation, results, and analysis.Would you like to proceed with reviewing the hfind.cpp file, or would you like guidance on a specific step in this project?
