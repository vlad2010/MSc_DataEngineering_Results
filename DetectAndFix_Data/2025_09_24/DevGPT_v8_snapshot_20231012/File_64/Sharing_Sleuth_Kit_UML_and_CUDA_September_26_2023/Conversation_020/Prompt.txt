wait but you need all the code to make this actually work on hash databases right?  So you're going to have to replicate a lot of the code that is not directly binary search in binsrch_index.cpp but the other stuff that would get this new Cuda file working in the tsk package?  And then compilation has to be different I"m sure of that right?  So where can we isolate the sleuth kit package to just be about hfind, ie. just need all the files that binsrch_index.cpp includes or uses and then we can copy them over to a new directory (is this the best way?), then add the new cuda file, write a new cmake and makefile or just a makefile, test it on the hash databases, time the executions and then also run the legacy hfind time it and then compare these in a Python Jupyter notebook.  Report findings to the sleuth kit repo owner to see if we can do a pull request.
