ChatGPTApologies for the confusion. It seems there might be an issue in how libcurl is handling the callback function or the verbose output in your specific environment. To ensure we are capturing the output correctly, let's try a different approach to debugging.Instead of relying on libcurl's verbose output, let's use std::cout to directly print the email body content in the read_data_callback function. By doing this, we can be sure that we are getting the correct email body data.Here's the modified read_data_callback function with std::cout:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Now, let's modify the main function to include the email content size, and instead of using CURLOPT_VERBOSE, we will enable libcurl's debug information to print to stderr:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Now, we'll add a new curl_debug_callback function to capture libcurl's debug information:[CODE_BLOCK_2]By using the curl_debug_callback, we should be able to capture the libcurl debug information, including the chunks of the email body, directly in the console output.Please try this modified version and observe the console output to see the debug information, including the email body chunks. If you encounter any issues or have more questions, feel free to let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
