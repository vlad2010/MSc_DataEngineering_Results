ChatGPTUsed Ai PDFThe second PDF is a data sheet for the HUSB238, a USB Type-C Power Delivery Sink Controller by Hynetek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. The document provides comprehensive technical details about the HUSB238, including its features, applications, pin configurations, and operating conditions. Here are some key highlights:General DescriptionThe HUSB238 is a highly integrated USB Power Delivery (PD) controller for up to 100W power rating. It is compatible with PD3.0 and Type-C V1.4. It can also support Apple Divider 3, BC1.2 SDP, CDP, and DCP (Page 1).Pin ConfigurationThe HUSB238 has various pins like VIN, GATE, D+, D-, CC1, CC2, SCL, SDA, VSET, and ISET, each serving specific functions (Page 4).Operating ConditionsThe VIN Input Voltage Range is 3.24V to 21V, and the Operating Temperature Range (Junction) is -40°C to +125°C (Page 5).ProtectionsThe HUSB238 comes with Over-Voltage Protection, Under-Voltage Protection, and Over-Temperature Protection (Page 6).Theory of OperationThe HUSB238 uses the VSET and ISET pins to determine the Request Data Object (RDO) that it requests from the PD source. The RDO is determined by comparing the values set by the VSET and ISET pins with the internal factory-programmed fuse options (Page 9-10).We finished processing the whole document with the PDF Search plugin.
