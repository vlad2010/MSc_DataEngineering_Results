ChatGPTThe warning "interface enp113s0 does not currently exist" typically indicates that dnsmasq could not find an active network interface with the name enp113s0 at the time it started up. It's possible that the network interface was not initialized yet or was down when you attempted to start dnsmasq.If you didn't see this warning before, it could be due to a variety of factors:Timing: If you start dnsmasq very quickly after booting your computer, the network interface may not yet be initialized. In that case, you'd get this warning.State: Perhaps the interface was already up and configured with an IP address previously but was not this time.Configuration Changes: If there were any changes in network configuration scripts or system settings, that could also affect this.To answer your second question, a DHCP server does typically need to have a static IP address assigned to the interface it listens on. This is because it needs to know the subnet of the IP addresses it is distributing. However, dnsmasq is quite forgiving and will work for DHCP even if the interface is not configured, though it will issue a warning.Here are some things you can do:Ensure the enp113s0 interface is up before running dnsmasq. You can bring an interface up with sudo ip link set enp113s0 up.Assign a static IP address to the interface before starting dnsmasq:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Double-check your system's boot logs or use dmesg to see if there are any relevant messages about enp113s0.If you don't remember seeing the warning before, it's possible that the interface was already initialized and perhaps even had an IP address assigned, which would prevent the warning from appearing.
