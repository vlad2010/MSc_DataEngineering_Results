The top readme says,`Also included is the 'hfind' tool. The 'hfind' tool allows one to create an index of a hash database and perform quick lookups using a binary search algorithm` what is hfind doing and what's with all the hashing md5 and everything during disk forensics?  Also I saw this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21662870/9481613 which is parallelizing binary search on CUDA so there that could be my first opportunity to use CUDA but where is the source code for binary search for hfind?
