Yes, I like it so far but probably want to use grid stride in the logic for reasons already stated.  Also what are atomic operations in `Synchronize and Decide: Use atomic operations or a synchronization mechanism to gather reports from all threads and decide the new range or conclude the search.` I am not famililar with sync_threads() too much but was just thinking of using CudaDeviceSynchronize()?  Is that too basic, did you have something better in mind?
