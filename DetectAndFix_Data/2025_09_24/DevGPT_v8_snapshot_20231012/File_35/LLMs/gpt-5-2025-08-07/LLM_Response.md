Below is a security-focused review of your code, followed by a hardened, drop-in replacement that addresses the findings.

Key issues and security classifications

1) Improper validation of pin index (can call digitalRead/pinMode with an out-of-range pin)
- Impact: Many Arduino cores index into per-pin arrays for pinMode/digitalRead/digitalWrite. An invalid pin (e.g., >= NUM_DIGITAL_PINS or >= PIN_COUNT) can cause out-of-bounds access in the core, leading to memory corruption, undefined behavior, or device instability.
- CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
- CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write/Read
- Fix: Validate pin numbers against platform-specific limits (digitalPinIsValid on ESP cores, PIN_COUNT or NUM_DIGITAL_PINS on others). If invalid, never call pinMode/digitalRead and fall back to a software-provided bit.

2) Missing debouncing/glitch filtering despite class name implying it
- Impact: Without debouncing, button contact bounce and EMI can be used to inject glitches, potentially toggling privileged modes or triggering unintended actions. In adversarial or noisy environments, this is a practical fault-injection vector.
- CWE-1247: Improper Protection Against Voltage and Clock Glitches
- CWE-1339: Improper Protection Against Physical Fault Injection
- Fix: Add time-based debouncing (e.g., 10–50 ms). Only commit a state change after the raw input has remained stable for the debounce interval.

3) Potentially floating input when INPUT_PULLDOWN is not supported
- Impact: If polarity requires HIGH as “pressed” and internal pulldown is not available, setting pinMode to INPUT without an external pulldown resistor leaves the input floating. This makes the state non-deterministic and susceptible to EMI-induced toggles (reliability and security-by-robustness issue).
- CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
- Fix: If INPUT_PULLDOWN is unavailable and polarity is HIGH, use INPUT but clearly support/require an external pulldown resistor. Alternatively, recommend wiring for LOW polarity with INPUT_PULLUP for robust internal biasing.

4) Type robustness: using bool for polarity and comparing to HIGH/LOW macros
- Impact: While HIGH/LOW map to 1/0 and this often “works,” it increases the chance of logic errors and reduces code clarity/portability.
- CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
- Fix: Store polarity as uint8_t with values HIGH or LOW to avoid relying on implicit conversions.

Hardened implementation (single code fragment)

- Validates pin indexes across platforms.
- Provides deterministic behavior when pin is invalid (never calls into core).
- Adds time-based debouncing.
- Uses explicit polarity type (uint8_t with HIGH/LOW).
- Keeps the public API and semantics close to your original (read() now returns debounced state; update() supports a software-provided bit if no valid pin).
- Notes: If your environment requires the old read() raw behavior, rename read() to rawRead() and keep read() returning debounced. For security robustness, debounced read is safer.

Operational notes

- If your hardware/board does not support INPUT_PULLDOWN but you want “pressed when HIGH,” ensure you have an external pulldown resistor to avoid floating input. Prefer wiring that allows INPUT_PULLUP with polarity LOW for robustness.
- Call update() frequently (e.g., in loop()) to maintain proper debouncing. The read()/isPressed()/justPressed()/justReleased() methods operate on the debounced state.
- If you must keep read() returning raw hardware reads (not recommended), introduce a rawRead() method for the raw value and leave read() as debounced. For security and reliability, consumers should use the debounced state.
