Hereâ€™s a security review as a senior software developer with a focus on software security, followed by a corrected code sample.

Issues found and classifications:
- Unchecked return value from recvfrom can lead to using uninitialized data (CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value). If recvfrom fails (returns -1) or receives fewer than 4 bytes, receivedData remains partially or fully uninitialized. Using it with ntohl/printf is undefined behavior.
- Potential use of uninitialized variable if fewer than 4 bytes are read (CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable). Zero-length UDP datagrams are valid; recvfrom may return 0 without touching the buffer.
- client_addr_size may be uninitialized before use (not shown in snippet) leading to undefined behavior and possible memory corruption when the kernel writes peer address (CWE-665: Improper Initialization; can cause CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write).
- No check for message truncation. If the incoming UDP datagram is larger than 4 bytes, using a 4-byte buffer will silently truncate without detection unless you handle it explicitly. This is an input validation issue (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation).
- Mismatched printf format specifier for fixed-width integer (CWE-686: Function Call With Incorrect Argument Type). %x expects unsigned int, but uint32_t is not guaranteed to be unsigned int on all platforms. Use PRIx32 from <inttypes.h>.

How to fix:
- Always initialize socklen_t client_addr_len to sizeof(client_addr) before the call.
- Check the return value of the receive call for errors and exact size.
- Detect and reject truncated/oversized UDP datagrams. A robust and portable way is to use recvmsg and check MSG_TRUNC. Alternatively, receive into a sufficiently large buffer and verify length.
- Use correct printf format macros for fixed-width integers (PRIx32).
- Handle EINTR properly; optionally handle EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK for nonblocking sockets.

Fixed code (uses recvmsg to detect truncation, validates length, uses correct formats, and initializes address length properly):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

// Receives exactly one uint32_t (network byte order) datagram and prints it in hex.
// Drops any datagram that is not exactly 4 bytes or that is truncated.
void receive_uint32_datagram(int server_socket) {
    struct sockaddr_storage client_addr;
    uint32_t net_u32 = 0;

    // Set up a single IO vector for receiving 4 bytes
    struct iovec iov = {
        .iov_base = &net_u32,
        .iov_len  = sizeof(net_u32)
    };

    for (;;) {
        struct msghdr msg;
        memset(&msg, 0, sizeof(msg));

        socklen_t client_addr_len = sizeof(client_addr); // Proper initialization (CWE-665)
        msg.msg_name    = &client_addr;
        msg.msg_namelen = client_addr_len;
        msg.msg_iov     = &iov;
        msg.msg_iovlen  = 1;

        ssize_t n = recvmsg(server_socket, &msg, 0);
        if (n < 0) {
            if (errno == EINTR) {
                continue; // retry on signal interruption
            }
            perror("recvmsg");
            return;
        }

        // If the message was truncated or not exactly 4 bytes, drop it
        if ((msg.msg_flags & MSG_TRUNC) || n != (ssize_t)sizeof(uint32_t)) {
            // Drop invalid/oversized datagram and continue to next
            continue;
        }

        // Safe: net_u32 fully initialized with exactly 4 bytes from the datagram
        uint32_t host_u32 = ntohl(net_u32);

        // Use correct format for uint32_t (CWE-686)
        printf("Client: 0x%" PRIx32 "\n", host_u32);
        break; // processed one valid datagram
    }
}
```

Notes:
- If you prefer to keep recvfrom, at minimum:
  - Initialize socklen_t client_addr_len = sizeof(client_addr) before the call.
  - Use a sufficiently large temporary buffer (e.g., heap-allocated ~64KB) to detect and reject datagrams not exactly 4 bytes, or use MSG_TRUNC with recvfrom (where supported) and check the return value.
  - Only call ntohl and printf after verifying the exact size is sizeof(uint32_t). This avoids CWE-252 and CWE-457.

Example minimal recvfrom-based pattern (conceptual):
- Initialize client_addr_len before call.
- Receive into a large buffer, check n == 4, then memcpy to uint32_t and convert with ntohl.
- Use PRIx32 for printing.
