ChatGPTApologies for the oversight. I realize that I forgot to include the definition of the EmailData structure in the previous code. Let's define the EmailData structure before the read_data_callback function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By adding the definition of the EmailData structure, the EmailData type will no longer be undefined, and the code should compile and work as expected. Once again, I apologize for the omission, and thank you for bringing it to my attention.With this modification, please try running the program again, and you should see the debug printout for the body of the email being sent. If you encounter any further issues or have more questions, feel free to let me know, and I'll be glad to assist you further.
