ChatGPTIf you have a machine with two interfaces each on different networks and both interfaces have the same IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.2), when you run a program to bind to 192.168.1.2, it's not about connecting to network 1 or network 2. Instead, the program is telling the operating system to receive traffic sent to 192.168.1.2, regardless of which network the traffic arrives on.In other words, if a program binds a socket to 192.168.1.2, it will receive traffic sent to 192.168.1.2 on both interfaces. If a packet is sent to 192.168.1.2 on network 1, the program will receive that packet. If another packet is sent to 192.168.1.2 on network 2, the program will also receive that packet.However, it's important to note that this behavior might depend on the specifics of your operating system and network configuration. Some systems might allow you to specify the interface when binding a socket, in which case you could create one socket bound to 192.168.1.2 on eth0 and another socket bound to 192.168.1.2 on eth1.Also, keep in mind that using the same IP address on multiple interfaces, especially when those interfaces are connected to different networks, can make your network configuration more complex and difficult to manage. It might lead to unexpected behavior and can make troubleshooting network issues more challenging.
