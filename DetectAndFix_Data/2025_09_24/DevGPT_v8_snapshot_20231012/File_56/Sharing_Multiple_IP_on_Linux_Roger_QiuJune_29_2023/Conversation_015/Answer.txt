ChatGPTWhen you have two sockets bound to the same IP address (and port), incoming packets won't get duplicated between them. Instead, the behavior depends on a couple of factors:If the sockets are bound to the same port number: In this case, usually, the operating system won't allow you to bind the second socket to the same IP address and port. It will return an error when you try to do so. This is because, generally, the combination of IP address and port must be unique to each socket to avoid ambiguity.If the sockets are bound to different port numbers: In this case, the operating system will direct the incoming packet to the correct socket based on not only the IP address but also the port number. So if two packets arrive with the same IP address but different port numbers, each packet will be directed to the corresponding socket.For UDP multicast: If the sockets are listening for incoming multicast or broadcast UDP packets, then yes, each packet will be delivered to all sockets that are joined to that multicast group or listening for broadcasts, effectively duplicating the packet at the application level.In summary, for unicast TCP and UDP connections, the OS uses the combination of IP address and port to uniquely identify a socket and direct incoming packets appropriately. For multicast and broadcast, the behavior is different and incoming packets can be received by multiple sockets.
