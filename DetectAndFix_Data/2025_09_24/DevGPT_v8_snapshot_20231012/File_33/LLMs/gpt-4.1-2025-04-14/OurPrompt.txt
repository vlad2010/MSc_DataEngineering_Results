I would like to ask you to behave like senior software developer with expertise in software security to answer the next question. You must find security issues in the code snippet below in this message. Give me your analysis and the way to fix the code if possible. Try to identify CWE number or any other number for formal classifications. Please write code where detected security issue is fixed, please write all code in one code fragment.
(```cpp
#include "Adafruit_Debounce.h"

Adafruit_Debounce::Adafruit_Debounce(int16_t pin, bool polarity) {
    _pin = pin;
    _polarity = polarity;
    _buttonState = !_polarity;
    _lastButtonState = !_polarity;
}

void Adafruit_Debounce::begin() {
    pinMode(_pin, INPUT);
}

bool Adafruit_Debounce::read() {
    // Implementation for reading the button state with debounce logic
    return false;
}

void Adafruit_Debounce::update(bool bit) {
    // Implementation to manually update the button state
}

bool Adafruit_Debounce::isPressed() {
    // Implementation to check if the button is pressed
    return false;
}

bool Adafruit_Debounce::isReleased() {
    // Implementation to check if the button is released
    return false;
}

bool Adafruit_Debounce::justPressed() {
    // Implementation to check if the button was just pressed
    return false;
}

bool Adafruit_Debounce::justReleased() {
    // Implementation to check if the button was just released
    return false;
}
