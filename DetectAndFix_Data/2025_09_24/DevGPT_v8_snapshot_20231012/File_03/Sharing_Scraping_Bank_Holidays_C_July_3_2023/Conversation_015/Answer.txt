ChatGPTA segmentation fault (segfault) typically occurs when a program tries to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access. This can happen due to various reasons, such as dereferencing a null pointer or accessing an array out of bounds.In the case of your program, a segmentation fault might occur if there is an issue with memory access or if the data extracted from the HTML is not in the expected format. To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following steps:Make sure that the curl library is successfully fetching the HTML content from the website. You can add some debug statements to check the fetched HTML content before attempting to parse it. For example, you can add the following code snippet before calling htmlContent = ...:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This will print the fetched HTML content to the console, allowing you to verify that it is retrieved correctly.Ensure that the HTML content is valid and in the expected format. You can also print the HTML content after parsing it using htmlDocDumpMemory() to verify if it is parsed correctly. For example, you can add the following code snippet after calling doc = ...:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will print the parsed HTML content to the console, allowing you to verify if it is parsed correctly.Check if the XPath expressions used to extract the data from the HTML are correct and matching the structure of the HTML content. If the structure of the HTML content has changed, the XPath expressions may need to be adjusted accordingly.Ensure that the extracted data is being handled correctly in the loop. Make sure that the variables date and holidayName are correctly assigned and used in the Markdown table generation.By following these steps and examining the debug output, you should be able to identify the source of the segmentation fault and fix the issue.
