ChatGPTTo process the raw HTML and extract the table containing the bank holidays, you can use a library like libxml2 in combination with the xpath expressions to navigate and extract the desired data. Here's an updated version of the program that processes the HTML and generates a table in Markdown format with the Date and Holiday Name columns:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This updated program includes additional code that uses the libxml2 library to parse the fetched HTML and extract the data from the table rows. It uses XPath expressions to select the relevant elements and retrieves the date and holiday name from each row. The extracted data is then printed in Markdown table format.Before compiling and running the program, make sure you have the libxml2 library installed on your system. You can install it using the package manager of your operating system (e.g., sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev on Ubuntu).Once you have the libxml2 library installed, you can compile and run the program as described earlier. The output will be a Markdown table with the Date and Holiday Name columns.
