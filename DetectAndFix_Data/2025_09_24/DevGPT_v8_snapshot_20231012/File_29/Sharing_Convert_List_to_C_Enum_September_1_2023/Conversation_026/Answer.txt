ChatGPTAh, I see. If you want to access a specific bit of a register, you can use the Adafruit_I2CRegisterBit class from the Adafruit_BusIO library. This class provides a way to read and write individual bits in an I2C register.Here's how you can modify the getAttached() function to use Adafruit_I2CRegisterBit to access the 7th bit of the PD_STATUS0 register:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code:HUSB238_PD_STATUS0 should be the actual register address for PD_STATUS0 (which you can take from the #defines we created earlier).I've assumed that the 7th bit indicates the "attached" status. You can adjust this based on the actual specifications of the HUSB238.Does this look closer to what you had in mind?
