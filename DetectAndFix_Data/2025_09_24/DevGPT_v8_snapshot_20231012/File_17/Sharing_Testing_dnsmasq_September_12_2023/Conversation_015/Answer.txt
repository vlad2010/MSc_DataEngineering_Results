ChatGPTIf the ip link set enp113s0 up command is not bringing the interface up, it's possible that the interface is not properly connected or that it requires additional steps to be initialized. You usually shouldn't need to have an RJ45 cable plugged in just to bring an Ethernet interface up, although some drivers might behave differently.Try using sudo with both commands and make sure to bring the interface up before checking its status:[CODE_BLOCK_0]If the interface is still down after running these commands, you might want to consult the system logs for any clues as to what might be going wrong. You can use commands like dmesg | grep enp113s0 or journalctl -xe to check for relevant log entries.If you add a static IP address and then try to bring it up, that might work, but generally speaking, the ip link set up command should be enough to bring the interface up regardless of its IP configuration.[CODE_BLOCK_1]After running these commands, ip a show enp113s0 should indicate that the interface is up and has the assigned IP address.
