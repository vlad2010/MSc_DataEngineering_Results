ChatGPTCertainly! Let's go through the Code - 1 solution step by step:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The given code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves processing multiple test cases. Let's understand what each part of the code does:while (tt--) { ... }: This is a while loop that runs tt times, where tt is the number of test cases. This loop is used to handle multiple test cases.int n, m, k, H;: These are variables to store the input values for each test case. The code expects four integers n, m, k, and H.cin >> n >> m >> k >> H;: This line reads the four integers n, m, k, and H from the input for the current test case.int ans = 0;: This initializes the variable ans to 0. It will be used to store the answer for the current test case.for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }: This is a for loop that iterates n times. It is used to process the elements of the current test case.int h; cin >> h;: This reads the value of the current element h from the input.if (h != H && h % k == H % k && abs(h - H) <= k * (m - 1)) { ... }: This is an if condition that checks certain conditions on the element h.h != H: It ensures that h is not equal to H, which means we are looking for elements that are different from the value H.h % k == H % k: It checks if the remainder when dividing h by k is equal to the remainder when dividing H by k. This condition implies that both h and H have the same residue when divided by k.abs(h - H) <= k * (m - 1): This condition checks whether the absolute difference between h and H is less than or equal to k * (m - 1). This condition ensures that the difference between h and H is within a certain range based on the value of k and m.If all these conditions are met for the current element h, then the block inside the if statement will be executed:ans += 1;: It increments the ans variable by 1, indicating that the current element h satisfies the conditions.cout << ans << '\n';: This prints the value of ans, which represents the number of elements in the current test case that satisfy the given conditions.Overall, the code reads the number of test cases tt, and for each test case, it reads four integers n, m, k, and H. Then, it processes n elements and counts the number of elements that satisfy specific conditions related to m, k, and H. For each test case, it prints the count of such elements. The process is repeated for all tt test cases.
